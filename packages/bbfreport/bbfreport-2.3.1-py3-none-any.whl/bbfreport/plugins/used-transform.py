"""Used transform plugin. This is invoked automatically.

It currently just visits the following types of node.

* `DataTypeRef`, to keep track of which `data types<DataType>` are used.

* `_HasContent`, to keep track of which `abbref<AbbreviationsItem>`,
  `bibref<Reference>`, `gloref<GlossaryItem>` and `template<Template>`
  items are referenced.
