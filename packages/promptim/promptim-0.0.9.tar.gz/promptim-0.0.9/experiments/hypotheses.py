Put exceptions in queue.py & Reduce pool size?
print in the psycopg code on where the connection is put back - are they called where you expect they get called?
Hypos:
Connection not returned to pool??
Combinations of calls on run (ptch thread; patch run/delete run)
Transactions too long?
Check timeouts?
