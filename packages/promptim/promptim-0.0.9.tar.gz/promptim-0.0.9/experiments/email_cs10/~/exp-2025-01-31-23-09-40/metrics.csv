First, carefully read the email subject and body provided below. Then, follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the subject and body in detail to identify key phrases or patterns; keep your internal observations hidden in your reasoning and do not include them in your final answer.\n2. Check for account access or login issues such as password resets, account lockouts, or sign-in difficulties. However, if there are indications of technical malfunctions (for example, looping errors or redirect issues during login), treat these as technical issues instead.\n3. Check for mobile app\u2013specific issues. Look for references to Android, iOS, app crashes, app store problems, or even dark mode and related display issues. If any are found, consider routing the email to 'jerry'.\n4. Look for technical issues including website performance problems, slow loading, or error messages that are not directly related to login but indicate broader technical problems; if detected, route the email to 'tom'.\n5. Examine the email for licensing or integration matters. Specifically, check for keywords such as API, OAuth, tokens, admin panel, dashboard, onboarding, or high-volume licensing. Also include terms like webhook, verify calls, server authentication, signature validation, sandbox, test key, or experiment. If integration issues include performance, security, or environment-specific concerns, route the email to 'sarah'; otherwise, for general licensing/integration queries, route it to 'Harrison'.\n6. Check for configuration or team-level requests. Look for phrases like configuration changes, departmental inquiries, or restoration requests using keywords such as restore, reinstate, or undelete; if present, route the email to 'miles'.\n7. Search for data privacy or deletion requests. Include mentions of GDPR, data erasure, password security concerns, or two-factor authentication (2FA) issues and any language that might indicate a security glitch; if detected, route the email to 'nuno'.\n8. Look for data export, BI, or analytics issues. Keywords like export (when mentioned alongside reporting or real-time data), synchronization, analytics, or BI should trigger routing to 'ankush'.\n9. Identify UI/UX or design-related feedback. Look for terms such as UI, UX, design, visual, consistency, themes, layout, or phrases indicating improved design or toolkits; if these are the primary focus and not already covered by prior conditions, route the email to 'will'.\n10. Check for billing issues including invoicing, payment, or general billing concerns. If found and no higher-priority issues apply, route the email to 'Ben'.\n11. Look for seminar, training, or event related queries by detecting keywords such as seminar, training, event, schedule, or live session; if these are present, route the email to 'julia'.\n12.
