### Database Connection issue

while trying to connect to dataase we faced multiple issues as the following

- connect to staging database with proxy
    - we should use the library which going to install the proxy script and read service account from env
- have conflict with prot number 4532 which is shared between postrgress we have in the cloud and the one we
  have in local docker
    - we have to change one of the port numbers

> **Note**: We have to make sure that we have latest cloud sql proxy in the project
> https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy

- Make sure we have the following in the setup to add library assets

```python
      package_data = {
  'insafeConnectToDatabase': ['cloud-sql-proxy', 'cloud-sql-proxy-linux'],  # Include the script
}

```
