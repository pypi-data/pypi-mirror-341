    General config for creating a Mamba block inside MBLM.
    Uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters.

    Parameters in brackets [x] denote the notation used in Mambabyte

    Parameters:
        n_layers: Number of layers [n]
        d_model: Residual stream dimension [d]
        expand: Linear layers expansion factor (always 2) [e]
        d_state: SSM state dimension [n_state]
        d_conv: Convolutional kernel size (always 4) [k]
        headdim: Head dimension
        dropout: The dropout in the Mamba block
    Note:
        `headdim` is a Mamba2 parameter only. There is no `dt_rank` [r]
        low-rank projection dimension in Mamba2
