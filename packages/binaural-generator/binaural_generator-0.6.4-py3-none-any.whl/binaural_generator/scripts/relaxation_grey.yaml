# Relaxation Grey: Perceptually Balanced Relaxation
# A relaxation session using alpha waves with grey noise for a natural ambient sound
# Grey noise is filtered to match the human ear's frequency response, creating a
# perceptually balanced sound that feels more natural and less artificial.

title: Relaxation (Grey Noise)
base_frequency: 100 # Hz (carrier frequency)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (audio sample rate)
output_filename: "audio/relaxation_grey.flac" # Default output file name

# Background noise settings
background_noise:
  type: "grey" # Grey noise has a perceptually flat frequency spectrum
  amplitude: 0.18 # Moderate amplitude for ambient presence

# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 20 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Transition from waking (Beta) to relaxed (Alpha) state
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 14 # Hz (beta - normal waking state)
    end_frequency: 10 # Hz (high alpha - relaxed but alert)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 20 # seconds

  # 2. First relaxation plateau - high alpha
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10 # Hz (high alpha - relaxed alertness)
    duration: 240 # seconds (4 minutes)

  # 3. Transition to deeper relaxation
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 10 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 8 # Hz (lower alpha - deeper relaxation)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)

  # 4. Deep relaxation plateau - low alpha
  - type: stable
    frequency: 8 # Hz (low alpha - deeply relaxed)
    duration: 360 # seconds (6 minutes)

  # 5. Brief transition to high alpha for re-alerting
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 8 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 10 # Hz (high alpha - return to relaxed alertness)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)

  # 6. Completion - high alpha with fade out
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10 # Hz (high alpha)
    duration: 60 # seconds (1 minute)
    fade_out_duration: 30 # seconds
