# Migraine Relief Binaural Beat Script
# Total Duration: 30 minutes
# Purpose: To reduce migraine pain and related symptoms through progressive relaxation

# Global settings
title: Migraine Relief (Alpha/Theta/Delta)
base_frequency: 144 # Hz (carrier frequency optimized for headache relief)
sample_rate: 48000 # Hz (higher sample rate for improved fidelity)
output_filename: "audio/migraine_relief.flac"

# Research basis:
# - Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) reduce anxiety and tension commonly associated with migraines
# - Theta waves (4-7 Hz) can decrease pain perception and promote deep relaxation
# - Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz) promote neurochemical release (serotonin, endorphins) that may help with pain
# - Studies indicate Alpha/Theta protocols may help with pain management (Prinsloo et al., 2018)
# - Gradual frequency reductions avoid jarring transitions that may exacerbate migraine sensitivity

# Total Duration: 30 minutes

steps:
  # Phase 1: Initial Pain Reduction (300 seconds)
  # Start with higher Alpha to gently begin relaxation without jarring sensory input
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10.5 # Hz (higher Alpha)
    duration: 300 # seconds

  # Phase 2: Alpha Relaxation Deepening (480 seconds)
  # Gradual transition to lower Alpha for deeper relaxation and reduced tension
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 10.5 # Hz
    end_frequency: 8 # Hz (lower Alpha)
    duration: 480 # seconds

  # Phase 3: Alpha-Theta Transition (420 seconds)
  # Bridge to therapeutic Theta frequencies associated with pain reduction
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 8 # Hz (Alpha)
    end_frequency: 6 # Hz (upper Theta)
    duration: 420 # seconds

  # Phase 4: Deep Theta for Pain Relief (420 seconds)
  # Research shows mid-Theta frequencies can significantly reduce pain perception
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 6 # Hz
    end_frequency: 4.5 # Hz (mid Theta)
    duration: 420 # seconds

  # Phase 5: Therapeutic Delta (180 seconds)
  # Brief exposure to upper Delta to promote neurochemical release for pain relief
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 4.5 # Hz (Theta)
    end_frequency: 3.5 # Hz (upper Delta)
    duration: 180 # seconds
