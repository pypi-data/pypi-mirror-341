# Creativity Blue: Enhanced Creative Flow
# A creativity session using theta waves with blue noise for a bright backdrop
# Blue noise emphasizes mid to high frequencies, creating a "crisp" sound quality
# that may help maintain clarity while in creative theta states.

title: Creativity (Blue Noise)
base_frequency: 100 # Hz (carrier frequency)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (audio sample rate)
output_filename: "audio/creativity_blue.flac" # Default output file name

# Background noise settings
background_noise:
  type: "blue" # Blue noise has energy proportional to f (brighter sound)
  amplitude: 0.15 # Moderate amplitude to provide subtle brightness

# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 25 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Transition from normal awareness to creative state
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 12 # Hz (lower beta - normal awareness)
    end_frequency: 7.83 # Hz (Schumann resonance - earth's natural frequency)
    duration: 240 # seconds (4 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 20 # seconds

  # 2. Schumann resonance plateau - align with earth's natural frequency
  - type: stable
    frequency: 7.83 # Hz (Schumann resonance - natural frequency)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)

  # 3. Transition to deeper theta for inspiration
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 7.83 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 6 # Hz (mid-theta - inspiration and creativity)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)

  # 4. Creative inspiration state - mid-theta
  - type: stable
    frequency: 6 # Hz (mid-theta - idea generation)
    duration: 600 # seconds (10 minutes)

  # 5. Transition back to grounded awareness
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 6 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 10 # Hz (alpha - relaxed but aware)
    duration: 240 # seconds (4 minutes)

  # 6. Return to normal awareness with fade out
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10 # Hz (alpha)
    duration: 60 # seconds (1 minute)
    fade_out_duration: 30 # seconds
