# Binaural Beat Script for Sleep Induction (Delta Waves)
# Aims to guide the brain towards deep sleep states.

# Global settings
title: Sleep (Delta)
base_frequency: 90 # Hz (Lower carrier might feel 'softer')
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz
output_filename: "audio/sleep_delta.flac"

# Sequence (Total Duration: 45 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Start at low Alpha (calm baseline) (300 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 8 # Hz (Low Alpha)
    duration: 300 # seconds

  # 2. Transition down through Theta (600 seconds)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 8 (implied)
    end_frequency: 5 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 600 # seconds

  # 3. Hold Theta (light sleep/drowsiness) (600 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 5 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 600 # seconds

  # 4. Transition slowly to Delta (600 seconds)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 5 (implied)
    end_frequency: 2 # Hz (Delta)
    duration: 600 # seconds

  # 5. Hold Delta for deep sleep induction (600 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 2 # Hz (Delta)
    duration: 600 # seconds
