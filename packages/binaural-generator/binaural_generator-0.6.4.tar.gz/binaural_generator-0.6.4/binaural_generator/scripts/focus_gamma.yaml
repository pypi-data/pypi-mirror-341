# Binaural Beat Script for Peak Focus (Gamma Waves)
# Aims for high-level cognitive processing and problem-solving.

# Global settings
title: Focus (Gamma)
base_frequency: 150 # Hz (slightly higher carrier for potentially clearer high freq beats)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz
output_filename: "audio/focus_gamma.flac"

# Sequence (Total Duration: 30 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Start at Alpha for baseline calm (120 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10 # Hz (Alpha)
    duration: 120 # seconds

  # 2. Transition up through Beta (300 seconds)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 10 (implied)
    end_frequency: 20 # Hz (Mid-Beta)
    duration: 300 # seconds

  # 3. Transition further to Gamma (180 seconds)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 20 (implied)
    end_frequency: 40 # Hz (Gamma)
    duration: 180 # seconds

  # 4. Hold Gamma for peak concentration (900 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 40 # Hz (Gamma)
    duration: 900 # seconds

  # 5. Gentle ramp down back to Beta (180 seconds)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 40 (implied)
    end_frequency: 15 # Hz (Low Beta)
    duration: 180 # seconds

  # 6. Hold low Beta to ease out (120 seconds)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 15 # Hz (Low Beta)
    duration: 120 # seconds
