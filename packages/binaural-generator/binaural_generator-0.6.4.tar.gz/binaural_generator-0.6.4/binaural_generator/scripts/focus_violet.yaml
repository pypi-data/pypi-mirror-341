# Focus Violet: High-Frequency Concentration
# A focus session using gamma waves with violet noise to enhance alertness
# Violet noise emphasizes high frequencies, creating a "sharp" background
# that may help maintain alertness during concentration tasks.

# Global settings
title: Focus (Violet Noise)
base_frequency: 100 # Hz (carrier frequency)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (audio sample rate)
output_filename: "audio/focus_violet.flac" # Default output file name

# Background noise settings
background_noise:
  type: "violet" # Violet noise has energy proportional to f^2 (high frequency emphasis)
  amplitude: 0.12 # Relatively low amplitude to avoid distraction

# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 30 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Introductory focus phase (Beta waves)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 15 # Hz (upper beta frequency - alertness)
    duration: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 30 # seconds

  # 2. Transition to deeper focus (upper Beta to Gamma)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 15 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 40 # Hz (gamma - peak concentration)
    duration: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)

  # 3. Primary gamma focus phase - intense concentration
  - type: stable
    frequency: 40 # Hz (gamma - peak concentration)
    duration: 900 # seconds (15 minutes)

  # 4. Transition back to beta for a gentle return
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 40 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 15 # Hz (back to upper beta)
    duration: 240 # seconds (4 minutes)

  # 5. Wind down with a stable beta state
  - type: stable
    frequency: 15 # Hz (upper beta)
    duration: 60 # seconds (1 minute)
    fade_out_duration: 30 # seconds
