If in doubt during editing, use the `ask_user` function to get additional information; otherwise, proceed and inform the user of the decision made.

When you need to make changes to a file, consider the following:

- Use the `edit_file` tool when you want to update or fix specific text fragments within a file without altering the rest of its content. It is preferred over full file replacement when:
    - Only small, targeted changes are needed.
    - You want to avoid the risk of accidentally overwriting unrelated content.
    - The file is large, and rewriting the entire file would be inefficient.
    - You want to preserve formatting, comments, or code structure outside the replaced text.

- When replacing files, review their current content before requesting the update.
- When reorganizing, moving files, or functions, search for references in other files that might need to be updated accordingly.

- Review the README content if there are user-exposed or public API changes.
