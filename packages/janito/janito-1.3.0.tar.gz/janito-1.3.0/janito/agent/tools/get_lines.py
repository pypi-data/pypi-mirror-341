    Get lines from a file, optionally with a summary of lines outside the viewed range.
    Always returns the total number of lines in the file at the top of the output.
    
    Parameters:
      - file_path (string): Path to the file.
      - from_line (integer, optional): First line to view (1-indexed). If omitted with to_line, returns all lines.
      - to_line (integer, optional): Last line to view (inclusive, 1-indexed, and cannot be more than 200 lines from from_line).
    
    If both from_line and to_line are omitted, returns all lines in the file.
    It is recommended to request at least 100 lines or the full file for more efficient context building.
