<!-- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects to a custom plugin of [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) called [JADX-AI-MCP](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp) and provides reverse engineering capabilities directly to local LLMs like Claude Desktop.-->

## ü§ñ What is JADX-MCP-SERVER?

**JADX MCP Server** is a standalone Python server that interacts with a modified version of `jadx-gui` (see: [jadx-ai-mcp](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp)) via MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets LLMs communicate with the decompiled Android app context live.


## ü§ñ What is JADX-AI-MCP?

**JADX-AI-MCP** is a plugin for the [JADX decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) that integrates directly with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropic/mcp) to provide **live reverse engineering support with LLMs like Claude**.

Think: "Decompile ‚Üí Context-Aware Code Review ‚Üí AI Recommendations" ‚Äî all in real time.

Watch the demo!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od86IOkkaHg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od86IOkkaHg&autoplay=1)

It is combination of two tools:
1. [JADX-AI-MCP](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp)
2. JADX MCP SERVER

## Current MCP Tools

The following MCP tools are available:

- `fetch_current_class()` ‚Äî Get the class name and full source of selected class
- `get_selected_text()` ‚Äî Get currently selected text
- `get_all_classes()` ‚Äî List all classes in the project
- `get_class_source(class_name)` ‚Äî Get full source of a given class
- `get_method_by_name(class_name, method_name)` ‚Äî Fetch a method‚Äôs source
- `search_method_by_name(method_name)` ‚Äî Search method across classes
- `get_methods_of_class(class_name)` ‚Äî List methods in a class
- `get_fields_of_class(class_name)` ‚Äî List fields in a class
- `get_method_code(class_name, method_name)` ‚Äî Alias for `get_method_by_name` //to be removed
- `get_smali_of_class(class_name)` ‚Äî Fetch smali of class

[READ HERE](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-getting-started)

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap

 - Add Support for apktool

 - Add support for hermes code (ReactNative Application)

 - Add more useful MCP Tools

 - Make LLM be able to modify code on JADX

 - Add prompts templates, give llm access to Android APK Files as Resources

 - **END-GOAL** : Make all android reverse engineering and APK modification tools Connect with single MCP server to make reverse engineering apk files as easy as possible purely from vibes.

## üôè Credits

This project is a plugin for JADX, an amazing open-source Android decompiler created and maintained by [@skylot](https://github.com/skylot). All core decompilation logic belongs to them. I have only extended it to support my MCP server with AI capabilities.

[üìé Original README (JADX)](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

The original README.md from jadx is included here in this repository for reference and credit.

This MCP server is made possible by the extensibility of JADX-GUI and the amazing Android reverse engineering community.

Also huge thanks to [@aaddrick](https://github.com/aaddrick) for developing Claude desktop for Debian based linux.

And in last thanks to [@anthropics](https://github.com/anthropics) for developing the Model Context Protocol and [@FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) team
