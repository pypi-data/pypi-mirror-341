## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contribute
You want to help develop CraftBeerPi4? To get you quickly stated, this repository comes with a preconfigured
development environment. To be able to use this environment you need 2 things installed on your computer:

- docker
- visual studio code (vscode)

To start developing clone this repository, open the folder in vscode and use the _development container_ feature. The command is called _Reopen in container_. Please note that this quick start setup does not work if you want to develop directly on a 32bit raspberry pi os because docker is only available for 64bit arm plattform. Please use the regular development setup for that.

For a more detailed description of a development setup without the _development container_ feature see the documentation page:
[gitbook.io](https://openbrewing.gitbook.io/craftbeerpi4_support/)
