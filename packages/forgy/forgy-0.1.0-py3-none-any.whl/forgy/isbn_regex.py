r"""Some notes on ISBN
ISBN is the international standard book number that was
adopted by ISO as a unique identifier for books and some
other publications. It is a ten- or thirteen-digit number,
containing four or five groups of numbers for ISBN10 and
ISBN13 respectively, used to manage books in libraries,
bookstores, publishing houses, etc. Although there are other
identifiers, ISBN remains a very common identifier for books.

The format of the ISBN identifier is:\d{a}\d{b}\d{c}\{d}\{e},
where a+b+c+d=10 for ISBN10 and a+b+c+d=13 for ISBN13.
Separators may also be included between the groups.

The ISBN identifier has five parts denoted by letters \d{a} to
\d{e}. In the ISBN, the first (a) and last(e) groups have a
fixed number of elements 3 and 1 respectively. The remaining
groups (b,c,d) vary in length.

The groups in ISBN are defined below;
1. Prefix element (a): The prefix element has a constant length
                        of 3 digits. It is issued by GS1 and
                        valued 978 or 979. It only applied to
                        ISBN-13.

2. Registration group element (b): It represents country, geogra-
                                    phical region, or language
                                    group of the place of publi-
                                    cation of book. The registra-
                                    tion group element Of the ISBN
                                    ranges from 1 to 5 digits in
                                    length. This code is assigned
                                    by the international ISBN Agency.

3. Registrant element (c): This identifies a publisher within
                            the publication group and is issued
                            by country ISBN agency, at location of
                            publication, to each publisher. The
                            length ranges from 1 to 7 digits and
                            is inversely proportioal to the
                            publisher's output.

4. Publication element(d): It identifies specific titles or
                            editions by a publisher. The length
                            of the publication element ranges
                            from 1 to 6 digits and is directly
                            propeortional to publisher output
                            with a zero indicating the absence
                            of a digit.

5. Check digit (e): The check digit establishes the validity
                    of the ISBN identifier. It has a constant
                    length of 1 digit. Its value is calculated
                    using a modulus 11 (for isbn 10) or modulus
                    10 (for isbn 13) algorithm.

# ISBN regex pattern explanation:
# -The first group:
#  (\d{3}-|\d{3}\s|\d{3}:|\d{3})?
#  Captures prefix element in ISBN-13

# -The second group:
#  (\d{1,5}[-\s]\d{1,7}[-\s]\d{1,6}(?:[-\s])?(?:[\dxX])?|\d{9}[\dxX]?)
#  The terms before pipe operator "|" capture ISBN-10 with
#  groups separated by space or hyphen, ISBN-10 ending in x
#  or X, ISBN-13 with separators when the first group is
#  matched also, 9-digit SBNs with separators (if matching
#  stops at \d{1,6}). After the pipe operator, regex matches
#  9 digit SBNs with no separators, ISBN-10 with 10 digits and
#  no separators, ISBN-10 (with no separators) ending in x or X.
#
# NOTEs:
# - SBNs have no check digit and prefix elements, so we only matched
#   the three variable groups.
# - It may be difficult to find ISBN patterns not yet included in
#   the regex expression above as the aforementioned cover almost
#   all ISBN formats available.
# - We have captured two groups in regex to separate the prefix
#   element from the remaining groups. To match regex as one number
#   without capturing the groups separately, the formats of the
#   groups are changed from (...)(...) to (?:...)(?:...) to match
#   and not capture the two groups as separate.

    Checks if an extracted ISBN is valid.

    ISBN -10 and -13 have 10 and 13 digits is a 13 digit
    number. The last digit of an ISBN number is the check
    digit. This number can be verified using the previous
    12 (for ISBN-13) or previous 9 digits (for ISBN-10).
    The calculation involved is called check digit
    calculation and it's been explained by the official
    ISBN agency @ www.isbn.org (see links to useful
    resources below). Specific explanations for each ISBN
    type are given below.

    ISBN-10 validation (modulus 11 operation):
    When each number (starting from the beginning) is
    multiplied by numbers 10 to 1, the resulting sum must
    be divisible by 11. In practice, we exclude the last
    digit from this summation and simply multiply first 9
    digit by numbers 10 to 2 and adding all the products.
    The calculated check digit is the number needed to
    make the total sum equal next higher multiple of 11.
    That is, when the resulting sum is added to the check
    digit, the result must be divisible by 11 without a
    remainder for the number to be a valid ISBN-10 number.
    This is the main priciple behind ISBN-10 check digit
    calculation. To carryout the calculation on a computer,
    a modulo 11 operation is used.

    ISBN-13 validation (a mod 10 operation):
    When each number in an ISBN number is multiplied by
    alternating 1 and 3 till the 13th digit, the resulting
    sum must be divisible by 10. In practice, we exclude
    the last digit in this calculation and instead multiply
    the first 12 digits by alternating 1 and 3 and sum all
    products. The calculated check digit is the number needed
    to make the calculated sum to be the next higher multiple
    of 10. This implies that when the calculated sum is added
    to the unknown check digit, the resulting number must be
    a multiple of 10 without a remainder for the number to be
    a valid ISBN. This is the method employed in ISBN-10 check
    digit calculation, and it is carried out on computer using
    modulo 10 operation on alternating 1 and 3 multipliers.

    The resulting sum should be the number needed to
    make the total sum the next higher multiple of 11. That
    is, when the resulting sum is added to the check digit,
    the result must be divisible by 11 without a remainder
    for the number to be a valid ISBN-10 number. This is the
    main priciple behind ISBN 10 check digit calculation.
    To carryout the calculation on a computer, a modulo 11
    operation is used.

    NB: Modulus operator simply takes the remainder when a
    number is divided by another. For instance, modulus (mod)
    11 is simply the remainder when a number is divided by 11.
    The format is "N modulus 11", or "N % 11" in python.
    Example: 35 modulus 11 = 2 (in python: 35 % 11)
