# ModelIterator Implementation Status

## Original Plan vs Implementation

The ModelIterator has been fully implemented in `builder/iterate.py` following the design philosophy outlined in CLAUDE.md. It allows for systematic discovery of multiple semantically distinct models for logical examples.

## Completed Features

1. **Core `ModelIterator` Class**
   - ✅ Properly initializes from BuildExample with validation
   - ✅ Maintains clear data flow with explicit parameter passing  
   - ✅ Implements `iterate()` method to find multiple distinct models
   - ✅ Implements `reset_iterator()` to restart the iteration process
   - ✅ Follows "fail fast" philosophy with clear error messages

2. **Constraint Generation**
   - ✅ Implemented `_create_difference_constraint()` to require differences from previous models
   - ✅ Implemented `_create_extended_constraints()` to combine original and difference constraints
   - ✅ Added support for theory-specific difference constraints with `create_difference_constraints()` hook
   - ✅ Added generic fallback for theories without custom constraint generators

3. **Model Building**
   - ✅ Builds completely new model structures for each iteration
   - ✅ Implements proper initialization using a two-phase pattern (base attributes then Z3-dependent attributes)
   - ✅ Calculates and stores differences between models for presentation

4. **Isomorphism Detection**
   - ✅ Added NetworkX integration for graph-based isomorphism checking
   - ✅ Implements `_check_isomorphism()` to detect structurally equivalent models
   - ✅ Adds non-isomorphic constraints with `_create_non_isomorphic_constraint()`
   - ✅ Includes "escape" mechanism to handle consecutive isomorphic models

5. **Settings Integration**
   - ✅ Extracts and validates settings with `_get_iteration_settings()`
   - ✅ Supports timeout settings for the iteration process
   - ✅ Handles iteration count and other configuration options

6. **Difference Display**
   - ✅ Detects differences between models with dedicated methods
   - ✅ Has theory-specific model difference detection
   - ✅ Provides formatted difference display

7. **Module-Level API**
   - ✅ Implements `iterate_example()` convenience function

## Integration with Theories

The implementation includes hooks for theory-specific functionality:

1. **Default Theory** (`default/semantic.py`)
   - ✅ Implements `get_differentiable_functions()` to identify which functions to use for differentiation
   - ✅ Implements `create_difference_constraints()` for theory-specific constraints
   - ✅ Implements `detect_model_differences()` and `format_model_differences()` for difference tracking and display
   - ✅ Includes structural constraints for non-isomorphism

## Improvements Over Original Design

1. **Enhanced Isomorphism Handling**
   - Added dedicated graph representation for models
   - Implemented strategy to escape from isomorphic models with stronger constraints

2. **Two-Phase Model Construction**
   - Uses proper object creation pattern to initialize new model structures
   - Clearly separates base attributes from Z3-dependent attributes

3. **Robust Difference Detection**
   - Implements both generic and theory-specific difference detection
   - Provides rich visualization of model differences

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Uses cached constraints where possible
   - Implements timeouts for both overall process and internal operations
   - Limits constraint generation to meaningful components

## What Remains To Be Done

The core implementation is complete and working. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Additional Theory Support**
   - Implement theory-specific hooks in other theories (exclusion, imposition, bimodal)
   - Add specialized difference visualization for each theory

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhance the difference visualization for Jupyter integration
   - Add interactive model comparison tools

3. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Implement more aggressive caching strategies
   - Add parallel solving for iteration

4. **Advanced Model Features**
   - Add support for model minimization (smallest distinguishing models)
   - Add support for targeted differences in specific components

## Implementation Note

The implementation follows the design philosophy outlined in CLAUDE.md:

- **Fail Fast**: Errors occur naturally with standard Python tracebacks
- **Deterministic Behavior**: No default values or implicit conversions
- **Required Parameters**: All parameters explicitly required
- **Clear Data Flow**: Consistent approach to passing data between components
- **No Silent Failures**: Exceptions are not caught to avoid errors
- **Explicit World References**: World IDs explicitly provided where needed

The code is robust, well-documented, and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
