## About ocean4DVarNet

**4DVarNet** (short for **4D-Variational Network**) is a deep learning-based framework that combines ideas from data assimilation (specifically **4D-Var**) with neural networks to reconstruct high-resolution spatiotemporal data from incomplete and noisy observations, commonly applied in **Earth sciences** like oceanography and meteorology.
