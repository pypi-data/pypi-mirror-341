# ppm Package

`ppm` is a Python Project Manager CLI tool that simplifies project setup, dependency management, environment configuration, and running project commands. This tool is ideal for developers looking for a structured and efficient way to manage project dependencies, execute scripts, and configure environment variables directly from the command line. This is all in one cli tools for long pip commands.

## Overview

The `ppm` tool provides a convenient set of commands for Python project management, enabling you to:

-   **Initialize Projects**: Set up a new project structure with a default or custom configuration.
-   **Install and Uninstall Packages**: Add or remove Python packages as needed for your project.
-   **Manage Environment Variables**: Easily configure environment variables for your project.
-   **Run Project Scripts**: Execute project-specific scripts or commands from a customizable list.

The `ppm` CLI is designed to streamline project management, reducing setup time and effort so that you can focus on coding.

 > Yes
   No

github repository name () https://github.com/rahulcodepython/New_Repo.git
```

This is for generating .env file.

```bash
[?] Are you sure you want to add .env file?:
   Yes
 > No
```

But if you have already .env file in your project, then you will encounter

```bash
[?] .env file already exists.:
   Overwrite
 > Keep as it is

.env file is untouched.
```

PPM will create a src folder in your root directory and inside it, it will generate a `main.py` file. If you have already this folder structure, you will be asked:
