- Real-time AI response and physical parameter adjustment
- Enable your devices to understand and execute complex instructions
- Enable device interconnection through MQTT protocol

## Key Features

- **MCP Protocol Integration**
  - Complete support for Model Context Protocol
  - Resource management and tool invocation support
  - Flexible prompt system
  - Command publishing and response through MQTT

## Configuration Guide

### MQTT Configuration
```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: "localhost"  # MQTT server address
  port: 1883  # MQTT server port
  client_id: "mcp2mqtt_client"  # MQTT client ID
  username: "mqtt_user"  # MQTT username
  password: "mqtt_password"  # MQTT password
  keepalive: 60  # Keep-alive time
  topics:
    command:
      publish: "mcp/command"  # Command publishing topic
      subscribe: "mcp/response"  # Response subscription topic
    status:
      publish: "mcp/status"  # Status publishing topic
      subscribe: "mcp/control"  # Control command subscription topic
```

### Command Configuration
```yaml
commands:
  set_pwm:
    command: "CMD_PWM {frequency}"
    need_parse: false
    data_type: "ascii"
    prompts:
      - "Set PWM to maximum"
      - "Set PWM to minimum"
    mqtt_topic: "mcp/pwm"  # MQTT publish topic
    response_topic: "mcp/pwm/response"  # MQTT response topic
```

## Supported Clients

mcp2mqtt supports all clients implementing the MCP protocol and IoT devices supporting the MQTT protocol:

| Client Type | Feature Support | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Claude Desktop | Full Support | Recommended, supports all MCP features |
| Continue | Full Support | Excellent development tool integration |
| Cline | Resource + Tools | Supports multiple AI providers |
| MQTT Devices | Pub/Sub | Supports all MQTT-compatible IoT devices |

## Quick Start

### Prepare
Python>=3.11 
Claude Desktop or Cline+Vscode


### Installation

#### For Windows Users
```bash
# Download the installation script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcp2everything/mcp2mqtt/main/install.py

# Run the installation script
python install.py
```

#### For macOS Users
```bash
# Download the installation script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcp2everything/mcp2mqtt/main/install_macos.py

# Run the installation script
python3 install_macos.py
```

#### For Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi Users
```bash
# Download the installation script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcp2everything/mcp2mqtt/main/install_ubuntu.py

# Run the installation script
python3 install_ubuntu.py
```

The installation script will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check system environment
- ‚úÖ Install required dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create default configuration file
- ‚úÖ Configure Claude Desktop (if installed)
- ‚úÖ Check serial devices

### Configuration File Location

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) can be placed in different locations depending on your needs:

#### 1. Current Working Directory (For Development)
- Path: `./config.yaml`
- Example: If you run the program from `C:\Projects`, it will look for `C:\Projects\config.yaml`
- Best for: Development and testing
- No special permissions required

#### 2. User's Home Directory (Recommended for Personal Use)
```bash
# Windows
C:\Users\YourName\.mcp2mqtt\config.yaml

# macOS
/Users/YourName/.mcp2mqtt/config.yaml

# Linux
/home/username/.mcp2mqtt/config.yaml
```
- Best for: Personal configuration
- Create the `.mcp2mqtt` directory if it doesn't exist:
  ```bash
  # Windows (in Command Prompt)
  mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.mcp2mqtt"
  
  # macOS/Linux
  mkdir -p ~/.mcp2mqtt
  ```

#### 3. System-wide Configuration (For Multi-user Setup)
```bash
# Windows (requires admin rights)
C:\ProgramData\mcp2mqtt\config.yaml

# macOS/Linux (requires sudo/root)
/etc/mcp2mqtt/config.yaml
```
- Best for: Shared configuration in multi-user environments
- Create the directory with appropriate permissions:
  ```bash
  # Windows (as administrator)
  mkdir "C:\ProgramData\mcp2mqtt"
  
  # macOS/Linux (as root)
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/mcp2mqtt
  sudo chown root:root /etc/mcp2mqtt
  sudo chmod 755 /etc/mcp2mqtt
  ```

The program searches for the configuration file in this order and uses the first valid file it finds. Choose the location based on your needs:
- For testing: use current directory
- For personal use: use home directory (recommended)
- For system-wide settings: use ProgramData or /etc

### Serial Port Configuration

Configure serial port and commands in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
# config.yaml
serial:
  port: COM11  # or auto-detect
  baud_rate: 115200

commands:
  set_pwm:
    command: "PWM {frequency}\n"
    need_parse: false
    prompts:
      - "Set PWM to {value}%"
```

3.MCP json Configuration
Add the following to your MCP client (like Claude Desktop or Cline) configuration file, making sure to update the path to your actual installation path:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp2mqtt": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp2mqtt"]
        }
    }
}
```
if you want to develop locally, you can use the following configuration:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp2mqtt": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "your project path/mcp2mqtt",  // ex: "C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/develop/my-mcp-server/mcp2mqtt"
                "run",
                "mcp2mqtt"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Important Notes:**
> 1. Use absolute paths only
> 2. Use forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\) as path separators
> 3. Ensure the path points to your actual project installation directory



4. launch your client(claude desktop or cline):


## Interacting with Claude

Once the service is running, you can control PWM through natural language conversations with Claude. Here are some example prompts:

- "Set PWM to 50%"
- "Turn PWM to maximum"
- "Turn off PWM output"
- "Adjust PWM frequency to 75%"
- "Can you set PWM to 25%?"

Claude will understand your intent and automatically invoke the appropriate commands. No need to remember specific command formats - just express your needs in natural language.

    command: "LED {state}\n"
    need_parse: false
    prompts:
      - "Turn on LED"
      - "Turn off LED"
```

### 2. Command with Response Parsing
```yaml
commands:
  get_temperature:
    command: "GET_TEMP\n"
    need_parse: true
    prompts:
      - "Get temperature"
```

Response example:
```python
{
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
        "raw": "OK TEMP=25.5"
    }
}
```
