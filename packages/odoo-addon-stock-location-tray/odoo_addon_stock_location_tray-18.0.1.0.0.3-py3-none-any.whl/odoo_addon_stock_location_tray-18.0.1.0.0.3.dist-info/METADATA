Add an optional Tray Type on Stock Locations. A tray type defines a
number of columns and rows. A location with a tray type becomes a tray,
and sub-locations are automatically created according to the columns and
rows of the tray type

Configuration
=============

General
-------

In Inventory Settings, you must have:

   - Storage Locations

Tray types
----------

Tray types can be configured in the Inventory settings. A tray type
defines how much cells a tray can hold. It is a square or rectangle
matrix of n cols \* m rows.

Locations
---------

The tray type can be configured in Stock Locations.

The tray type of a tray can be changed as long as none of its cell
contains products. When changed, it archives the cells and creates new
ones as configured on the new tray type.

The matrix widget on Tray locations can be clicked to reach a
sub-location. Blue squares represent the locations that contain goods.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The buttons on operations opens a view with the tray matrix to show
operators where to pick/put goods. The issue is that Odoo allows only
one modal popup to be open at a time. The tray matrix replaces the
operations window. We have to find a way to prevent this. The tray
matrix could be displayed through a tooltip maybe, if we find how to
render a widget in a tooltip.
