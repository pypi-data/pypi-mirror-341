`4.0.0`_ - 2025-04-16
---------------------

Notable, breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version requires AlekSIS-Core 4.0. It is incompatible with any previous
version.

Alsijil got a entire rewrite of both its frontend and backend.
The models formerly used for lesson documentation, notably
``LessonDocumentation`` and ``PersonalNote`` are replaced by new ones based on the calendar framework
provided by ``AlekSIS-Core`` and the absense framework provided by ``AlekSIS-App-Kolego``. The legacy
views providing management functionality for those legacy models are not available anymore.

Upgrade notice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're upgrading from 3.x, there is now a migration path to use.
Therefore, please install ``AlekSIS-App-Lesrooster`` which now
includes parts of the legacy Chronos and the migration path.
