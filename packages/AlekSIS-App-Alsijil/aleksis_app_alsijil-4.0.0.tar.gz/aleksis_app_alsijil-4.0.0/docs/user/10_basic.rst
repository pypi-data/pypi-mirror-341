Concept of Alsijil and overview about functionality
===================================================

AlekSIS provides a privacy-compliant online class register solution.
It is not simply the digital equivalent of a paper class book, although elements are adopted
for easier orientation and smoother transition for teachers. For example, there is a coursebook-like
view of all lessons and a list of all the students in the class. Lesson content,
notes about the student and also remarks about the learning group can be entered.

However, the application uses the possibilities and therefore the advantages of a digital application.
The student lists do not have to be filled in by the class teacher,
but are provided automatically by the system. The timetable is also already stored.

In addition, statistical evaluation, like counting absences, is done
automatically.
