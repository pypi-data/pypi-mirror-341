Basic data concepts
===================

Timetable data
--------------

The class register uses the data from the timetable app. This means that timetables with
all current changes such as substitutions, events and exams can be found directly in the class book.

Even basic settings such as lesson times, holidays and public holidays do not have to be
entered separately in the class book, as they are managed centrally.

Lesson documentations
---------------------

Three input fields are provided for the lesson content:

1. **Lesson topic:** The content of the lesson is to be noted here, if necessary with information on the material used.
2. **Homework:** In this field, the teacher can enter the homework for the next lesson.
3. **Group note:** Here, there is space for notes that concern the whole learning group, e.g. instructions, dates, or similar.

Participation status and personal notes
---------------------------------------

For each lesson, you will find a student list of the group. The following entries can be made there:

1. **Present/Absent:** Choice between present and different absence reasons, several types can be set up also for excuses, e.g. in case a student was absent due to a school event.
2. **Tardiness in minutes**
5. **Extra marks:** This item is also configurable. A selection field for missing homework or similar would be possible here.
6. **Notes:** One or multiple personal notes can be made about the student.

With the appropriate configuration, students can view all personal data concerning themselves.
