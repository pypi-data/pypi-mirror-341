The lesson documentation is a strictly non-personal information about the contents
of the lesson. It contains the topic, describing what contents were taught, and an
optional homework, describing what tasks students got for the next lesson.

Everything entered here should be considered public knowledge.

.. warning::
   Never add any personal information to the lesson documentation.

Students
~~~~~~~~

On the right side of each lesson, there is an indicator showing student data.
If there are no data entered for the lesson, it just will show the button *List of participants*.
Clicking on it will open a dialog for managing students.

If there is already some data about students in this lesson, the indicator will show the
number of students that are present and some details like absences or extra marks.

After opening the students dialog for a lesson, it shows a list of students
that should be in this lesson. If there are already information about
absences from other sources, students will be already marked.

By selecting one person, you can open a detailed page about the student in this lesson.
Here, you can change the participation status (from present to different absence reasons),
enter tardiness, write personal notes, or set extra marks. If you open the dialog during
the lesson, it will also offer you the current time as tardiness. Everything will be saved
automatically.

Often students are not only absent in one lesson, but also in the following. Therefore the
class register will offer you to extend the absence to the whole day.

Using the check boxes on the left side, you also can select multiple students at once
to mark them as absent, late, or set an extra mark.
