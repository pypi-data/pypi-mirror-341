Overview about absences
=======================

Also on the coursebook page there is a large button *Show absences*.
Similiar to the list of lessons, it will show you a ongoing list of absences.
It is possible to directly change the status of a student by clicking at
one of the absence reasons.

This view also supports the selection of multiple absences to change their
status together.
