* **User is allowed to register absences for members of groups the user is an owner of with these group types:**
  If a user is owner of a group with one of those group types, he is allowed to register absences for longer
  time periods for the persons in this group.
* **User is allowed to view coursebook statistics for members of groups the user is an owner of with these group types:**
  If a user is owner of a group with one of those group types, he is allowed to see class register statistics
  for the persons in this group.

  group type will be shown before all other groups in the select on the coursebook overview page (e. g. for classes).
