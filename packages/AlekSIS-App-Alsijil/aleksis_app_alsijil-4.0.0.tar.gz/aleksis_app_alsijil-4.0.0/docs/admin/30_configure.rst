Defining base data
==================

With sufficient authorisation, two additional menu items appear in the class register menu.

Absence reasons
---------------

Students can be absent due to different reasons. These absence reasons
can be managed at *Absences → Absence Reasons*. Please see the Kolego
documentation for further information. To show them in the class register,
set the tag *Class Register*.

Extra marks
-----------

Some remarks are repeated over and over again, such as 'Homework forgotten'.
In order not to have to write this again and again in the remark field,
additional marks can be set, which then only have to be clicked on in the class register.
To manage them, open *Class register → Extra marks*.
