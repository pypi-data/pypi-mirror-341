# Wayland MCP Server

> **Note:** This package was created because existing screenshot solutions didn't work reliably on my Wayland setup.
> **Wayland MCP** provides screenshot, analysis, mouse and keyboard control tools for modern Linux desktops.

## Features
  
  - **Custom VLM integration for analysis**
  - **Images comparison**
  - **Mouse & keyboard input simulation**


## ⚠️ Security Warning

> **WARNING:** Enabling input control gives the MCP server full access to your mouse and keyboard.
> Only use with trusted MCP servers and models.

## Input Control Setup

To enable mouse and keyboard control (move, click, drag, scroll, type):

```bash
./wayland_mcp/setup.sh
```

This configures permissions for `evemu-event` to control input devices.
