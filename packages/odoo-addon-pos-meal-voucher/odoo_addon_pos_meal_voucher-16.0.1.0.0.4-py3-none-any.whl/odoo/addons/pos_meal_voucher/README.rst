This module allows to handle meal vouchers in the point of sale.

Meal vouchers are a payment method, available in some countries (France, Belgium, Romania,…) that allows customers to buy food products in grocery stores or pay in restaurants.

Configuration
=============

Products
~~~~~~~~

On a product form, in the "Sales" tab, the "Can be Paid for by Meal Vouchers" checkbox controls whether the product can be paid for by meal vouchers.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/product_product_form.png

Product categories can be configured to have a default value for the "Can be Paid for by Meal Vouchers" field for its products.
The "Apply to All Products" button allows to set the value on all products of the category.

Point of Sale Payment Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point of sale payment methods (Point of Sale > Configuration > Payment Methods) have a "Meal Voucher Type" field that defines what type of meal voucher payment method they are:

* (empty): The payment method is not a meal voucher payment method.
* **Paper**: The payment method will be used when scanning meal voucher barcodes.
* **Electronic**: The payment method will be used for electronic meal vouchers.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

This module adds a "Meal Vouchers" section in the point of sale settings (Point of Sale > Configuration > Settings, or Settings > Point of Sale) with several options:

* **Maximum Amount**: Optional maximum amount per order that can be paid by meal vouchers. Set to 0 to disable.
* **Icon on Order Lines**: Whether to display an icon on point of sale order lines (on the product screen) for products that can be paid for by meal vouchers.
* **Information on Receipt**: Whether to display an asterisk (*) on receipts before each product that can be paid for by meal vouchers as well as the total eligible amount.

Receipt

The receipts can optionally contain information about the products that can be paid for by meal vouchers and the total amount of those products:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_meal_voucher/static/description/receipt_information.png

Barcodes
~~~~~~~~

A new barcode rule is defined for paper meal vouchers (with 24 characters):

``...........{NNNDD}........``

If you scan the following barcode: ``052566641320080017000000``, a new payment line with an amount of ¤8.00 (``00800``) will be added.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Possible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Introduce the Meal Voucher Issuer model.
* Deduce the issuer when scanning a meal voucher barcode.
* Add a report to easily compute the total deposit of meal vouchers (per issuer).
