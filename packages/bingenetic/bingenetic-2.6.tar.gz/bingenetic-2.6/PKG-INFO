## üîß **Development Details**
- **üë®‚Äçüíª Developer:** [Ravin Kumar](https://mr-ravin.github.io)  
- **üìÇ GitHub Repository:** [BinGenetic](https://github.com/mr-ravin/bingenetic)

---
## üì• **Installation**
```sh
pip install bingenetic
```
or,
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/mr-ravin/bingenetic.git
```

### üìå **Dependencies:**
- Python >= 3.7
- No additional dependencies required

## üöÄ **Usage & Examples**

### üîπ Binary Code to Genetic Code:
```python
import bingenetic

# Convert binary to DNA sequence
genetic_code = bingenetic.btg("00011011", "dna")  # Binary -> DNA
print(genetic_code)  # Output: 'ACGT'
```

### üîπ Genetic Code to Binary Code:
```python
import bingenetic

# Convert DNA sequence to binary
binary_code = bingenetic.gtb("ACGT", "dna")  # DNA -> Binary
print(binary_code)  # Output: '00011011'
```
