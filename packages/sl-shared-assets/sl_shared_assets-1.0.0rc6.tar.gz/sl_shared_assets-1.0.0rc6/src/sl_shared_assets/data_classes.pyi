    Zaber motor positions across consecutive runtimes for the same project and animal combination.

        All positions are saved using native motor units. All class fields initialize to default placeholders that are
        likely NOT safe to apply to the VR system. Do not apply the positions loaded from the file unless you are
        certain they are safe to use.

        Exercise caution when working with Zaber motors. The motors are powerful enough to damage the surrounding
        equipment and manipulated objects. Do not modify the data stored inside the .yaml file unless you know what you
        are doing.
