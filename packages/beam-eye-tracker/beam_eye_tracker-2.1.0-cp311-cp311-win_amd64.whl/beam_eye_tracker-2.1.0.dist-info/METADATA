# Beam Eye Tracker SDK 

The Beam Eye Tracker SDK leverages the [Beam Eye Tracker](https://beam.eyeware.tech/)'s head and eye tracking output to boost **immersion** and **performance** of video games. This package distributes the python bindings for it.

This API gives you access to real-time tracking data, such as head pose and eye gaze on screen, allowing to develop a **wide range of applications**, from accessibility solutions to intuitive interfaces and UX research tools. Given that only a webcam or smartphone is required, solutions become accessible to many users.

Free demo is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375780/Beam_Eye_Tracker/). For comprehensive documentation on the API, including installation guides, references, and integration examples, please visit [https://docs.beam.eyeware.tech/](https://docs.beam.eyeware.tech/).
