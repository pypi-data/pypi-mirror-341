# LIVESEARCH

This is a very simple package

```python
import livesearch

items = [
    "pineapple",
    "banana",
    "apple",
]

results = livesearch.search("app", items)

for res in results:
    print(res)
```

This will print:
```
apple
banana
```

## Notes

- Regex always enabled
