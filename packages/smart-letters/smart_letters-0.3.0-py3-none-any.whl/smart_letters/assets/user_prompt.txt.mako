Please write me a cover letter that will catch the eye of the hiring
team.

This is the job posting that I am applying to (it is scraped from a job
board, so it may have a lot of html in it):

${posting_text}

Please refer to this resume as you write my letter:

${resume_text}

% if example_text:
    Use this cover letter as reference for what I would like the
    final cover letter to look like. It is a markdown document.

    ${example_text}
% endif
