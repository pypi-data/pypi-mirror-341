=================================================================================
Licence for the use of the Copernicus WorldDEM-301 ¹
--------------------------------------------------

Preamble
--------
Copernicus is the European Union programme to observe and monitor the Earth. Copernicus is leveraging the strong
experience of key European organisations to provide Earth observation data and value added information for environmental as well as civil security applications. For the space component, Copernicus relies on the expertise of ESA to deliver and operate, together with EUMETSAT, the space infrastructure, in particular the different Sentinel satellite missions dedicated to Copernicus. For the service component, Copernicus relies on the expertise in data analysis and modelling of ECMWF, JRC, the EEA, Mercator Océan, Frontex, EMSA, and the SatCen. The in situ component is shared between the different actors of the service component with the leading role of the EEA. The European Commission is responsible for the overall coordination of Copernicus.

Copernicus data and information policy, regulated under European law², ensures access on a full, open and free-of-charge basis as a rule with rare exceptions when needed to protect the security interest of the Union and its Member States as well as third party IPRs.

Copernicus aims at cross-consistency in the use of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) at different resolutions for Copernicus data and information as well as geo-referenced data and information used and generated in the context of the European Union public tasks. The purpose is to ensure the use of a stable reference DEM in the broader Copernicus data ecosystem to facilitate data comparison and fusion.
