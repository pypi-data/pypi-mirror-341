# Dpsn Plugin for GOAT SDK

This plugin enables goat-agents to  connect  , subscribe to, and interact with data streams available on the [DPSN Data Streams MarketPlace](https://streams.dpsn.org/).

Agents can leverage this plugin to consume real-time data for decision-making, reacting to events, or integrating external information feeds.

To provide personalized data streams for your agents, you can create and publish data into your own DPSN topics using the [dpsn-client for node](https://github.com/DPSN-org/dpsn-client-nodejs).

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect your GOAT agents to DPSN's decentralized pub/sub network
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Subscribe to and process real-time data streams in your agents
- **Topic Management**: Subscribe and unsubscribe to DPSN topics programmatically or through llm queries
