**A package to reduce the size of 🤗 Hugging Face models via Vocabulary Slimming.**

Large language models (LLMs) increasingly adopt extensive vocabularies to better handle diverse tasks such as multilingual processing, code generation, and function-calling. Recent research highlights that expanding both model and vocabulary size enhances performance, following scaling laws with vocabulary.

However, larger vocabularies come with significant drawbacks. For smaller LLMs designed for specific tasks like English or Chinese chat applications on mobile devices, a large vocabulary can be inefficient. It consumes computational resources as the model must predict token probabilities at each decoding step. Additionally, token embeddings occupy memory and lead to larger activations during inference and fine-tuning, exacerbating the issue for smaller models(e.g., 26.53% for Qwen2.5-0.5B).

For instance, the Qwen2.5 series illustrates this challenge:

| Model                                | 0.5B   | 1.5B   | 3B     | 7B     | 14B    | 32B   | 72B   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Number of Parameters                 | 0.49B  | 1.54B  | 3.09B  | 7.61B  | 14.7B  | 32.5B | 72.7B |
| Number of Parameters (Non-Embedding) | 0.36B  | 1.31B  | 2.77B  | 6.53B  | 13.1B  | 31.0B | 70.0B |
| Ratio (Embeding Parameters)          | 26.53% | 14.93% | 10.36% | 14.19% | 10.88% | 4.61% | 3.71% |


Reducing the vocabulary can significantly shrink the model size and enhance memory efficiency for both inference and fine-tuning. This benefit is particularly pronounced when models are quantized, as most quantization methods avoid quantizing token embeddings and the language modeling head to preserve accuracy.



## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)
```bash
pip install vocab-slim
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andy1314Chen/vocab-slim.git
cd vocab-slim
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```


## Usage


### Command Line Interface
```bash
vocab-slim --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B --vocab_size 32000
```

### Python API
```python
from vocabslim import VocabSlim

# load pretrained tokenizer and model, train new BPE tokenizer
vocSlim = VocabSlim(model_name_or_path="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B",
                    save_path=f"Qwen2.5-0.5B-Vocab-Slimed-32K",
                    dataset_config={"name": "wikitext",
                                "config": "wikitext-103-raw-v1",
                                "split": "train",
                                "text_column": "text"},
                    target_vocab_size=32_000)

# vocabulary slimming and adjust embedding weight
vocSlim.prune()

# compare outputs between original and slimmed models with test text
vocSlim.check("What is the capital of France?")

# slimmed model and tokenizer are saved in save_path
```


### Evaluation

To evaluate the performance after vocabulary slimming, we used [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to compare on several common datasets.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from lm_eval.models.huggingface import HFLM
from lm_eval import simple_evaluate

model_path = "./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Vocab-Slimed-32K"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map="auto").eval()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

lm = HFLM(pretrained=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, batch_size=32)

results = simple_evaluate(model=lm, tasks=["arc_challenge", "hellaswag", "piqa"])
results = {key: value for key, value in results.items() if key == "results"}
print("Accuracy:", results)
```
