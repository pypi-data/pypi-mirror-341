    """Initialize and run a Pong game with configurable settings.

    This function creates an interactive Pong game using IPython widgets and canvas.
    The game supports different player modes, difficulty levels, and ball speeds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    players : int, optional
        Number of players in the game (default is 1)
        - 0: Two AI players
        - 1: One human player (left paddle) and one AI player (right paddle)
        - 2: Two human players
    difficulty_level : float, optional
        Difficulty level for AI players, between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 0.5)
        - 0.0: Easiest (slow and unpredictable AI)
        - 1.0: Hardest (fast and predictable AI)
    ball_speed : float, optional
        Initial speed of the ball (default is 5)
    canvas_width : int, optional
        Width of the game canvas in pixels (default is 600)
    canvas_height : int, optional
        Height of the game canvas in pixels (default is 400)

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    - The game is displayed in a Jupyter notebook using IPython widgets
    - Controls for human players:
        - Left paddle: 'w' (up) and 's' (down)
        - Right paddle: 'i' (up) and 'k' (down)
    - The game features dynamic difficulty adjustment and paddle size changes
    - Scores are displayed at the top of the game
