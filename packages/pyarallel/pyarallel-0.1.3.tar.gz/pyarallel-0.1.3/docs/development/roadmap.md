## Roadmap

Some of the features we're planning to add in the future:

### Observability & Debugging
- **Advanced Telemetry System**
  - Task execution metrics (duration, wait times, queue times)
  - Worker utilization tracking
  - Error frequency analysis
  - SQLite persistence for historical data
  - Interactive visualizations with Plotly
  - Performance bottleneck identification

------ 

- **Rich Logging System**
  - Configurable log levels per component
  - Structured logging for machine parsing
  - Contextual information for debugging
  - Log rotation and management
  - Integration with popular logging frameworks

### Advanced Features
- **Callback System**
  - Pre/post execution hooks
  - Error handling callbacks
  - Progress tracking
  - Custom metrics collection
  - State management hooks

------ 

- **Smart Scheduling**
  - Priority queues for tasks
  - Deadline-aware scheduling
  - Resource-aware task distribution
  - Adaptive batch sizing
  - Dynamic worker scaling

------ 

- **Fault Tolerance**
  - Automatic retries with backoff
  - Circuit breaker pattern
  - Fallback strategies
  - Dead letter queues
  - Task timeout handling

------ 

- **Resource Management**
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - CPU utilization tracking
  - Network bandwidth control
  - Disk I/O rate limiting
  - Resource quotas per task

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Decorator Ergonomics**
  - First-class, documented support for `@parallel` on instance methods, static methods, and class methods.
  - Automatic handling of `self` and `cls` arguments.
  - Clear examples and best practices for OOP usage.
- **CLI Tools**
  - Task monitoring dashboard
  - Performance profiling
  - Configuration management
  - Log analysis utilities
  - Telemetry visualization

### Enterprise Features
- **Integration**
  - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
  - Metrics export (Prometheus)
  - Log aggregation (ELK Stack)
