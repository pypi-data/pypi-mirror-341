A very basic chatbot based on openAI to console lonely engineering students... not me though, my girlfriend is wonderful :)

I used the openai API to generate responses. I used Polars to store and manipulate json files so the chatbot has memory of previous responses within the same session.

Install it using pip:

    pip install partnersimulator

Set up as:

    import partnersimulator as ps
    
    #affection levels are /100
    aishwarya = ps.partner(name='aishwarya rai', age=51, gender='female', mood='patient, kind, caring', affection=100)

    while True:
        message = input('Talk to me (say "quit" to exit): ')
        if message.lower() in ['quit', 'exit']:
            break
        print(aiswarya.send_message(message))

### Some notes:
You can really put anything you want for aishwarya.mood

Aishwarya Rai is a famous Indian actress. The use of her name is completely arbitrary.

When you run the code block above it will automatically generate a .json file with all the messages of the session included. If you change the name or age of your partner a new record is kept.

I hope this is as fun for you to play with as it was for me to build :)
