   - Click **Run**. This will generate a new layer showing farms that contain wells.

2. **Style the Results**:
   - Right-click the result layer, go to **Properties**, and style it to show only farms that have a well (e.g., using a different color or label).

#### Query 2: Calculate the Area of Each Farm and Show the Largest Farm

1. **Calculate Area**:
   - Right-click the **Farms Layer** and select **Open Field Calculator**.
   - In the expression box, type:
     ``` 
     $area
     ```
   - Name the field **"Area"** and set the field type to **Decimal Number**.
   - Click **OK** to create the area field.

2. **Show the Largest Farm**:
   - Go to the **Attribute Table** of the **Farms Layer**.
   - Sort the **Area** field in descending order.
   - The largest farm will be at the top.

#### Query 3: Show All the Paths that Intersect with Highways

1. **Perform a Spatial Query**:
   - Go to the **Processing Toolbox** and search for **"Extract by location"**.
   - Select the **Extract by location** tool.
   - Set the following parameters:
     - **Input layer**: Choose the **Paths Layer**.
     - **Predicates**: Choose **"Intersects"**.

   - Click **Run**. This will create a new layer showing all the paths that intersect with highways.

2. **Style the Results**:
   - Right-click the result layer and style it to make it visually distinct.

---

### Part 3: Creating the Map Layout

1. **Create the Map Layout**:
   - Go to **Project** > **New Print Layout** to create a new map layout.
   - Add a map, legend, scale bar, and title to the layout.
   - Customize the map to show all the layers and highlight the results of your queries.

2. **Export the Map**:
   - Once you’re happy with the map, go to **Layout** > **Export as Image** or **Export as PDF** to save your map.

---

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Create vector layers** for all features (Highways, Farms, Paths, Main Road, Farmhouses, Residential Areas, Schools, Bus Stops, Grampanchayat Office, and Wells).
2. **Add features** to the layers (e.g., farms, highways, roads, points for buildings).
3. **Perform spatial queries** using tools like **Join attributes by location**, **Extract by location**, and **Field Calculator** to calculate areas.
4. **Style and display the results** of queries (e.g., farms with wells, largest farm, paths intersecting highways).
5. **Create a map layout** and export the map for presentation.

This approach should allow you to create the necessary layers, features, and queries in QGIS effectively.

- **Output matrix type**: `Linear (N*k)`
- **Use only the nearest (k) target points**: `1` (nearest)
- Choose an output file: CSV or temporary layer

> This gives a table showing the distance from each house to its nearest bus stop.

---

### 🔹 Tool 2: **Count Points in Polygon** (Find how many houses fall in each building or park)

1. Go to **Processing Toolbox**
2. Search: **Count Points in Polygon**
3. Select: **Count Points in Polygon**

#### Set Parameters:
- **Polygon layer**: `buildings` or `parks`
- **Point layer**: `houses`
- Output: Save to temporary or file layer

> This adds a new field to the polygon layer showing the **count of points (houses)** inside each building/park.

---

## ✅ PART 3: View and Style Results

- Open **attribute tables** of your layers
- For Distance Matrix: View CSV to analyze nearest distances
- For Count in Polygon: Sort by count to find which building/park has most houses

---

## ✅ PART 4: Optional – Create a Layout Map

1. Go to **Project > New Print Layout**
2. Name: `Vector Analysis Map`
3. Add a map, title, legend, north arrow, and scale bar
4. Export as PDF or Image

[Hint: use signif.txt and ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp]

2

Add the following layers in QGIS

20

3

EarthquakeDatabase.txt

ne_10m_admin 0 countries.shp

Calculate the total earthquakes / Tsunami occurred in each country.

Show the total number of earthquake / Tsunami occurred in India.


Here's a **step-by-step solution in QGIS** for the tasks you've described. We'll cover how to:

1. **Perform Nearest Neighbor Analysis** to find the **nearest earthquake** to populated places.
2. **Add required layers** (`signif.txt`, `ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp`, `EarthquakeDatabase.txt`, `ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp`)
3. **Calculate earthquake/tsunami counts per country**, and extract count for **India**.

---

## ✅ Part 1: Nearest Neighbor Analysis

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Load Required Files into QGIS

1. Open QGIS.
2. Go to **Layer > Add Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer**
   - Browse to `signif.txt` (earthquake data)
   - Set X field: `LONGITUDE`, Y field: `LATITUDE`
   - CRS: `WGS 84` (EPSG:4326)
   - Click **Add** → layer will load as points.
3. Load `ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp`
   - Use **Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer**

✅ Now you have **earthquakes** and **populated places**.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Perform Nearest Neighbor Analysis

1. Open **Processing Toolbox**: `Processing > Toolbox`
2. Search for: `Distance to nearest hub`
   - Use: **"Distance to nearest hub (points to layer)"**
3. Fill parameters:
   - **Source points**: `ne_10m_populated_places_simple` (populated places)
   - **Destination hubs**: `signif` (earthquakes)
   - **Output distance field name**: `dist_to_eq`
   - Output layer: Save as temporary or permanent
4. Click **Run**

✅ You now have a new layer where each **populated place** has a field showing **distance to nearest earthquake**.

> Optionally, **sort by distance** to find the **most at-risk population centers**.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Add More Layers

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Add Earthquake and Country Data

1. Again use **Layer > Add Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer**
   - Browse to `EarthquakeDatabase.txt`
   - Set Longitude/Latitude fields if available (or it may be attribute-only data)
2. Add `ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp`
   - Vector → Open Vector Layer

✅ Now you have **country boundaries** and **earthquake records**.

---

## ✅ Part 3: Count Earthquakes and Tsunamis by Country

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Ensure Proper CRS and Join

1. Make sure all layers use **CRS: EPSG:4326 (WGS 84)**
2. Convert `EarthquakeDatabase.txt` to points (if it contains location fields):
   - Use Add Delimited Text Layer with `LONGITUDE`, `LATITUDE`
   - Layer name: `eq_points`

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Count Points in Polygons

1. Open **Vector > Analysis Tools > Count Points in Polygon**
2. Parameters:
   - **Polygons**: `ne_10m_admin_0_countries`
   - **Points**: `eq_points`
   - Field name: `quake_count`
3. Run → Output layer contains **earthquake counts per country**

> ✅ Optional: Use **filter** for tsunamis:
   - First create a filtered layer from `eq_points`:
   - **Right-click layer > Filter**
   - Apply: `"tsunami" = 1`
   - Use that layer in `Count Points in Polygon` to count tsunamis.

---

## ✅ Part 4: View Result for India

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Find Earthquake Count for India

1. Open **Attribute Table** of resulting layer (with `quake_count`)
2. Use **Select Features by Expression**:
   ```sql
   "NAME" = 'India'
   ```
3. You'll see India selected with a column `quake_count` showing the number of earthquakes.
