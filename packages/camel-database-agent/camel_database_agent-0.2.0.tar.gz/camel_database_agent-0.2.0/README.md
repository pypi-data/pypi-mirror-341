[![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/camel-database-agent)](https://pypi.org/project/camel-database-agent/)

An open-source toolkit helping developers build natural language database query solutions based on [CAMEL-AI](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).

## Core Components

- **DataQueryInferencePipeline**: A pipeline that transforms database schema and sample data into query few-shot examples (questions and corresponding SQL)
- **DatabaseKnowledge**: A vector database storing database schema, sample data, and query few-shot examples
- **DatabaseAgent**: An intelligent agent based on the CAMEL framework that utilizes DatabaseKnowledge to answer user questions

Features:

- [x] Read-Only mode
- [x] SQLite
- [x] MySQL
- [x] PostgreSQL  
- [ ] Spider 2.0-Lite evaluation (planned)

Database Overview
==================================================
This database is designed to support a digital music platform, encompassing key features for artist management, employee administration, customer relations, and sales transactions. 

### Key Features:

1. **Artist and Album Management**: 
   The `Artist` and `Album` tables form the foundation for managing musical artists and their respective albums. Each artist is uniquely identified and can have multiple albums linked to them, allowing for comprehensive tracking of discographies.

2. **Employee and Customer Management**:
   The `Employee` table captures detailed information about staff, including their roles, contact details, and reporting structure, which is essential for organizational management. The `Customer` table holds customer profiles, enabling personalized service and facilitating communication through provided contact information.

3. **Media Type and Genre Classification**:
   The `MediaType` and `Genre` tables classify music tracks, enabling easy filtering and searching for users based on their preferences for specific genres or media types (e.g. digital downloads, CDs). This classification enhances user experience by making music discovery intuitive and engaging.

4. **Track and Playlist Management**: 
   The `Track` table contains detailed attributes for individual music tracks, including duration and pricing. The `Playlist` table allows users to create and manage custom playlists, which can enrich user engagement and retention by providing a personalized listening experience.

5. **Sales Tracking and Invoicing**:
   The `Invoice` and `InvoiceLine` tables keep track of sales transactions, linking customers with the purchases they make. This structure not only supports effective billing through clear associations between invoices and the tracks purchased but also facilitates revenue tracking and financial reporting. The ability to view total sales and detailed line items allows for comprehensive sales analysis.

6. **Flexible Design for Data Relationships**:
   Through the use of foreign keys and relationships, such as the linkage between customers and their respective invoices, the database provides a robust structure for maintaining data integrity. The design ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible, promoting efficient database utilization.

Overall, this database structure provides a complete solution for managing a music platform, supporting critical business functions like customer engagement, sales tracking, and music cataloging. It enables organizations to operate efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience for both customers and internal staff.

## Spider 2.0-Lite(Planned)

[Spider 2.0-Lite](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite) is a text-to-SQL evaluation framework that includes 547 real enterprise-level database use cases, involving various database systems such as BigQuery, Snowflake, and SQLite, to assess the ability of language models in converting text to SQL in complex enterprise environments.

> This use case attempts to query the SQLite database based on user questions 
> and evaluate whether the SQL executes smoothly (**without assessing data accuracy**).

* spider2_lite/database/local_sqlite - SQLite database file. [Manual download required](spider2_lite/database/README.md).
* spider2_lite/spider2-lite.jsonl - Question and SQL pairs. [Link](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/spider2-lite/spider2-lite.jsonl)
* spider2_lite/spider2_run - Run the Spider 2.0-Lite evaluation.

Run the Spider 2.0-Lite evaluation.
