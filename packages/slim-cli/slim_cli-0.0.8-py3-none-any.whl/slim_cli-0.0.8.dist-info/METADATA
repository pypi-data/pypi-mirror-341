              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Quick Start

This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project. Please see our [docs](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/docs) for a more comprehensive overview.

### Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Git
* `.env` file to properly configure the environment for Azure and OpenAI APIs
  ```bash
  # .env for Azure
  AZURE_TENANT_ID=<Your-Azure-Tenant-ID>
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<Your-Azure-Client-ID>
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your-Azure-Client-Secret>
  API_ENDPOINT=<Your-Azure-OpenAI-API-Endpoint>
  API_VERSION=<Azure-OpenAI-API-Version>
  APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<Your-Azure-Subscription-Key>
  ```
  ```bash
  # .env for OpenAI
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>
  ```
* **Steps to use `ollama/llama3.3` as the local AI model:**
  1. **Download and Install `ollama`:**  
     Visit the [official Ollama website](https://ollama.com/) to download and install `ollama` for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

  2. **Start the `ollama` Service:**  
     Launch the `ollama` service to enable local model hosting. Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     ollama serve
     ```
  3. **Run and Test the Model:**  
     Verify the `ollama/llama3.3` model is working correctly by running the following command. Note that the first run may take some time to download the model:
     ```bash
     ollama run llama3.3
     ```
  
### Setup Instructions

As the SLIM CLI is written in Python, you'll need Python 3.7 or later. Usually, you'll want to create a virtual environment in order to isolate the dependencies of SLIM from other Python-using applications. Install into that environment using `pip`:

    pip install slim-cli

This installs the latest SLIM CLI and its dependencies from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/). The new console script `slim` is now ready for use. Confirm by running either:

    slim --version
    slim --help

To upgrade:

    pip install --upgrade slim-cli

Or select a specific version, such as `X.Y.Z`:

    pip install slim-cli==X.Y.Z

### Run Instructions

This section provides detailed commands to interact with the SLIM CLI. Each command includes various options that you can specify to tailor the tool's behavior to your needs.

**NOTE:**
To specify a logging level for the app, choose between `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`: 
```slim --logging DEBUG```

1. **List all available best practices**
   - This command lists all best practices fetched from the SLIM registry.
   ```bash
   slim list
   ```

2. **Apply best practices to repositories**
   - This command applies specified best practices to one or more repositories. It supports applying multiple practices simultaneously across multiple repositories, with AI customization options available.
   - `--best-practice-ids`: List of best practice IDs to apply.
   - `--repo-urls`: List of repository URLs to apply the best practices to; not used if `--repo-dir` is specified.
   - `--repo-dir`: Local directory path of the repository where the best practices will be applied.
   - `--clone-to-dir`: Path where the repository should be cloned if not present locally. Compatible with `--repo-urls`.
   - `--use-ai`: Enables AI features to customize the application of best practices based on the project’s specific needs. Specify the model provider and model name as an argument (e.g., `azure/gpt-4o`).
   ```bash
   slim apply --best-practice-ids SLIM-123 SLIM-456 --repo-urls https://github.com/your-username/your-repo1 https://github.com/your-username/your-repo2 
   ```
   - To apply a best practice using AI customization:
   ```bash
   # Apply a specific best practice using AI customization
   slim apply --best-practice-ids SLIM-123 --repo-urls https://github.com/your_org/your_repo.git --use-ai <model provider>/<model name>
   ```
   Example usage: 
   ```bash
   # Apply and deploy a best practice using Azure's GPT-4o model
   slim apply --best-practice-ids SLIM-3.1 --repo-urls https://github.com/riverma/terraformly/ --use-ai azure/gpt-4o
   ```
   ```bash
   # Apply and deploy a best practice using Ollama's LLaMA 3.1 model
   slim apply --best-practice-ids SLIM-3.1 --repo-urls https://github.com/riverma/terraformly/ --use-ai ollama/llama3.3
   ```
   
3. **Deploy a best practice**
   - After applying best practices, you may want to deploy (commit and push) them to a remote repository.
   - `--best-practice-ids`: List of best practice IDs that have been applied and are ready for deployment.
   - `--repo-dir`: The local directory of the repository where changes will be committed and pushed.
   - `--remote-name`: Specifies the remote name in the git configuration to which the changes will be pushed.
   - `--commit-message`: A message describing the changes for the commit.
   ```bash
   slim deploy --best-practice-ids SLIM-123 SLIM-456 --repo-dir /path/to/repo --remote-name origin --commit-message "Apply SLIM best practices"
   ```

4. **Apply and deploy a best practice**
   - Combines the application and deployment of a best practice into one step.
   - `--best-practice-ids`: List of best practice IDs to apply and then deploy.
   - `--repo-urls`: List of repository URLs for cloning if not already cloned; not used if `--repo-dir` is specified.
   - `--repo-dir`: Specifies the directory of the repository where the best practice will be applied and changes committed.
   - `--remote-name`: Specifies the remote to which the changes will be pushed. Format should be a GitHub-like URL base. For example `https://github.com/my_github_user`
   - `--commit-message`: A message describing the changes for the commit.
   - `--use-ai`: If specified, enables AI customization of the best practice before applying. False by default.
   ```bash
   slim apply-deploy --best-practice-ids SLIM-123 --repo-urls https://github.com/your-username/your-repo1 https://github.com/your-username/your-repo2 --remote-name origin --commit-message "Integrated SLIM best practice with AI customization"
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   AI features disabled
   Applied best practice SLIM-123 and committed to branch slim-123
   Pushed changes to remote origin on branch slim-123
   ```

### Generate Docusaurus documentation

The SLIM CLI includes a website generator that can automatically create [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) documentation from your repository content. This feature can analyze your codebase and generate comprehensive documentation including API references and installation guides.

#### Basic Usage

Generate documentation for your repository using:

```bash
python -m jpl.slim.cli generate-docs \
  --repo-dir /path/to/your/repo \
  --output-dir /path/to/output
```

#### AI-Enhanced Documentation

You can enable AI enhancement of the documentation using supported language models:

```bash
python -m jpl.slim.cli generate-docs \
  --repo-dir /path/to/your/repo \
  --output-dir /path/to/output \
  --use-ai ollama/llama3.3
```

Example usage:
```bash
python -m jpl.slim.cli generate-docs --repo-dir ./hysds --output-dir ./hysds/outputs --use-ai ollama/llama3.3
```

#### Generated Content

The documentation generator creates the following sections:

- **Overview**: Project description, features, and key concepts (from README)
- **Installation**: Setup instructions and prerequisites
- **API Reference**: Auto-generated API documentation from source code
- **Guides**: User guides and tutorials
- **Contributing**: Contributing guidelines
- **Changelog**: Version history and recent changes
- **Deployment**: Deployment instructions and configurations
- **Architecture**: System architecture and design documentation
- **Testing**: Testing documentation and examples
- **Security**: Security considerations and guidelines

#### Integration with Docusaurus

After generating the documentation, follow these steps to view it:

1. Install Docusaurus if you haven't already:
```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-docs classic
```

2. Copy the generated files to your Docusaurus docs directory:
```bash
cp /path/to/output/*.md my-docs/docs/
cp /path/to/output/docusaurus.config.js my-docs/
cp /path/to/output/sidebars.js my-docs/
cp -r /path/to/output/static/* my-docs/static/
```

3. Start the Docusaurus development server:
```bash
cd my-docs
npm start
```


### Unit Test Generation

The slim CLI includes an AI-powered test generation feature that can automatically create unit tests for your codebase. This tool analyzes your source code and generates appropriate test files using testing frameworks for each supported language.

#### Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Generates tests for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and C#
- **Framework-Specific**: Uses appropriate testing frameworks for each language:
  - Python: pytest
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest
  - Java: JUnit
  - C++: Google Test
  - C#: NUnit
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Generates tests for normal operations, edge cases, and error scenarios
- **Dependency Mocking**: Includes appropriate mocking setup for external dependencies

#### Usage
Generate tests for an entire repository:

```bash
python -m jpl.slim.cli generate-tests --repo-dir ./my-project --output-dir ./my-project/tests
```

#### Options

- `--repo-dir` (Required): Path to your repository directory
- `--output-dir` (Optional): Custom output directory for generated tests
- `--model` (Optional): AI model to use (default: "azure/gpt-4o")
- `--verbose`, `-v` (Optional): Enable detailed logging



#### Naming Conventions

Generated test files follow language-specific conventions:

| Language | Test File Format | Example |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Python | `test_*.py` | `test_utils.py` |
| JavaScript | `*.test.js` | `utils.test.js` |
| TypeScript | `*.spec.ts` | `utils.spec.ts` |
| Java | `Test*.java` | `TestUtils.java` |
| C++ | `*_test.cpp` | `utils_test.cpp` |
| C# | `*Tests.cs` | `UtilsTests.cs` |

#### Generated Test Structure

Tests are generated with:
- Appropriate imports and framework setup
- Test class/suite organization
- Setup and teardown methods when needed
- Comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Normal operation
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
  - External dependency mocking






### Running the CLI Locally

The CLI can be run using Python's module syntax.

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python -m jpl.slim.cli  [options]

### Local Development

For local development of SLIM CLI, clone the GitHub repository, create a virtual environment, and then install the package in editable mode into it:
```bash
git clone --quiet https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-cli.git
cd slim-cli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

The `slim` console-script is now ready in editable mode; changes you make to the source files under `src` are immediately reflected when run.

### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing. For detailed information about our testing framework, test structure, and how to run tests, please refer to our [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) document.

Here's a quick summary:

```bash
# Install pytest
pip install pytest

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/jpl/slim/test_cli.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v -s
```

### Publishing a New Version

To publish a new version of SLIM CLI to the Python Package Index, typically you'll update the `VERSION.txt` file; then do:
```bash
pip install build wheel twine
python3 -m build .
twine upload dist/*
```

(Note: this can and should eventually be automated with GitHub Actions.)
