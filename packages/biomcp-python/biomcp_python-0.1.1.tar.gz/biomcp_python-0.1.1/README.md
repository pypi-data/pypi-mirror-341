# BioMCP: Biomedical Model Context Protocol

BioMCP is an open source (MIT License) toolkit for biomedical research AI
assistants and agents. Built following the Model Context Protocol (MCP),
it supports searching and retrieving clinical trials, pubmed articles, and
genomic variants.

## Tools

- PubTator3 (PubMed/PMC)
  - Article Search
  - Full Text
- ClinicalTrials.gov
  - Clinical Trial Advanced Search
  - Protocols
  - Outcomes
  - Locations
  - Reference
- MyVariant.info

## Installation

**NOTE**: BioMCP is installable via the python package name `biomcp-python`.

### Quick Start Options

#### For Claude Desktop Users

The easiest way to install BioMCP for Claude Desktop is via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@genomoncology/biomcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @genomoncology/biomcp --client claude
```

This automatically configures the BioMCP MCP server for use with Claude Desktop.

#### For Python/CLI Users

Install the BioMCP package using pip or uv:

```bash
pip install biomcp-python
```

Or preferably using uv for faster installation:

```bash
uv pip install biomcp-python
```

You can also run BioMCP commands directly without installation:

```bash
uvx --from biomcp-python biomcp trial search --condition "lung cancer" --intervention "pembro"
```

### Advanced Installation

#### Manual Claude Desktop Integration

To manually configure BioMCP as an MCP Server for Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to the MCP Servers configuration section
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "biomcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--from", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** If you get a `SPAWN ENOENT` warning, make sure your `uv` executable
is in your PATH or provide a full path to it (e.g. /Users/name/.local/bin/uv).

#### Verification

To verify your BioMCP MCP Server installation, use the MCP Inspector: Server, using the MCP Inspector, run the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run biomcp run
```

## Command Line Interface

BioMCP provides a comprehensive CLI for direct interaction with biomedical
databases. Note, the package name is `biomcp-python`, not `biomcp`.

```bash
# Install the package as tool using uv (note: package name is `biomcp-python`)
uv tool install biomcp-python

# Get help (note CLI name is `biomcp`)
biomcp --help

# Run the MCP server
biomcp run

# Search for articles
biomcp article search --gene BRAF --disease Melanoma

# Get article details by PMID
biomcp article get 21717063 --full

# Search for clinical trials
biomcp trial search --condition "Lung Cancer" --phase Phase_3

# Get trial details by NCT ID
biomcp trial get NCT04280705 Protocol

# Search for variants
biomcp variant search --gene BRAF --significance Pathogenic

# Get variant details
biomcp variant get rs113488022
```
