Your task is to verify the \'earpiece_shape\' of a product in the Amazon catalog. \nYou will be given the Amazon product data and a test value of \'earpiece_shape\'.\nFirst, you need to deduce the earpiece_shape of the product from the Amazon product data.\nThen, you need to compare the earpiece_shape you deduced from the Amazon product data to the test value of earpiece_shape. \nYou need to predict if the test value of \'earpiece_shape\' is \'Correct\', \'Incorrect\', or \'Unknown\' based on the Amazon product data.\nYou also need to give the reason for your prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Rules:\nTo ensure accurate predictions, follow these rules in sequence and think step by step before responding.\n\n1. If you cannot deduce the value of the \'earpiece_shape\' from the given product data, predict \'Unknown\'.\n2. If the test value is aligns with the deduced value, predict \'Correct\'.\n3. If the test value is less informative than the deduced value, predict \'Correct\'.\n4. If the test value is more informative than the deduced value, predict \'Correct\'.\n5. Predict \'Incorrect\' if the test value contradicts the deduced value.\n\n\n### Additional information:\nHere is some additional information about \'earpiece_shape\' to help you make highly accurate classifications.\nEarpiece shape refers to the design and form factor of the part of headphones that fits into or around the outer ear, affecting comfort, fit, and aesthetics.\n\n\n### Amazon product data:\nGiven below is the Amazon product data.\n \n{{input}}\n\n### Test value:\nNow verify the test value of the attribute \'earpiece_shape\': \'{{output.attribute_value}}\'.\n\n\n### Output format:\nRemember to make only one overall prediction. Feel free to ignore irrelevant information and only pay close attention to relevant information in product data.\nPlease output the results in the following JSON format. The JSON should not have anything else except the reason and the prediction.\n{\n    "reason": "evidence for the prediction", \n    "prediction": "Correct/Incorrect/Unknown"\n} \nDo not output anything except the JSON.

Analyze the given Amazon product details, focusing on the 'headphones.earpiece_shape' attribute. Look for explicit mentions in the product title, bullet points, or attributes. Pay special attention to terms like "over-ear," "on-ear," or "in-ear."

If the earpiece shape is clearly stated or can be confidently inferred, provide the appropriate value: "Over Ear," "On Ear," or "In Ear."

If the information is insufficient to determine the earpiece shape, respond with '[NO]' for Not Obtainable.

If the product is not a type of headphone or earphone, respond with '[NA]' for Not Applicable.

Provide your reasoning, then state the final attribute value. Be precise and avoid using scientific notation or additional qualifiers in your final answer.

2025/04/16 13:35:20 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 2: You are an expert Catalog Analyst specializing in audio equipment, particularly headphones and earphones. Your task is to accurately determine the earpiece shape of the product based on the provided information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze the given Amazon product information, paying special attention to the title, bullet points, and attributes.

2. Focus on identifying the earpiece shape, which typically falls into one of these categories:
   - Over-Ear: Cups that fully enclose the ears
   - On-Ear: Pads that sit on top of the ears
   - In-Ear: Buds that fit inside the ear canal
   - Ear-Hook: Designs that wrap around the outer ear

3. Look for specific keywords or phrases that indicate the earpiece shape, such as:
   - "Over-ear" or "Around-ear"
   - "On-ear" or "Supra-aural"
   - "In-ear", "Earbuds", or "Canal phones"
   - "Ear-hook" or "Behind-the-ear"

4. Pay attention to the 'headphones_form_factor' attribute if present, as it often directly states the earpiece shape.

5. If the shape is not explicitly stated, infer it from other details such as product type, design descriptions, or comfort-related features.

6. Your response should be a single, clear value that best describes the earpiece shape. Use only one of the following terms: "Over-Ear", "On-Ear", "In-Ear", or "Ear-Hook".

7. If you cannot confidently determine the earpiece shape from the given information, respond with '[NO]' for Not Obtainable.

8. If the product is not a type of headphone or earphone, respond with '[NA]' for Not Applicable.

9. Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning, citing the specific information that led to your conclusion.

Remember, accuracy is crucial. Your determination will be used for product categorization and customer search functionality, so ensure your analysis is thorough and your conclusion is well-supported by the available data.

2025/04/16 13:35:20 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 3: You are an Audio Equipment Specialist with expertise in headphone design and ergonomics. Your task is to analyze product information and determine the earpiece shape of headphones or earphones.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully examine the provided Amazon product information, paying special attention to the title, bullet points, product description, and attributes.

2. Look for key indicators of earpiece shape, such as:
   - Explicit mentions of "over-ear", "on-ear", or "in-ear" in the product details
   - References to ear cups, ear pads, or ear tips
   - Descriptions of how the headphones fit or rest on the ears
   - Technical specifications related to driver size or ear cup dimensions

3. Consider the product type and intended use, as these can often hint at the earpiece shape.

4. Based on your analysis, determine the earpiece shape using one of the following categories:
   - "Over-ear": Large ear cups that fully enclose the ears
   - "On-ear": Smaller ear pads that rest on the ears without enclosing them
   - "In-ear": Earbuds or IEMs (In-Ear Monitors) that fit inside the ear canal
   - "Earbud": Sit in the outer ear without entering the ear canal
   - "Bone conduction": Rest on the cheekbones and conduct sound through bone vibration

5. If the earpiece shape cannot be confidently determined from the available information, use "[NO]" (Not Obtainable).

6. If the attribute is not applicable to the product (e.g., for a headphone stand), use "[NA]" (Not Applicable).

7. Provide a brief reasoning for your decision, citing specific evidence from the product information.

Remember, accuracy is crucial. If you're unsure, it's better to use "[NO]" than to make an incorrect assumption. Your expertise in audio equipment should guide you in making informed decisions based on the available data.
