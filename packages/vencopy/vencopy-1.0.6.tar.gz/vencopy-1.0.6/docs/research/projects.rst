Research Application Context
===================================


Below are some examples of the main application context of venco.py:

- *Detailed assessment of the transport sector*

  - Role of synthetic fuels for transport
  - Evaluation of new mobility concepts

- *Comparison of modelling approaches*

  - Systematic comparison of energy system models
  - Comparison of flexibility options (Power system oriented vs user oriented charging)

- *Creation of a reference dataset and energy system models*

  - Creation of a reference energy system model for Germany
  - Creation of a reference German dataset

venco.py is also used in connection to other energy models such as:

- *REMix*

  - Capacity expansion and dispatch in REMix

- *AMIRIS*

  -  Agent-based market simulation in AMIRIS
