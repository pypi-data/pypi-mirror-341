# ðŸ”» giza

ðŸ”» `giza` is a Mathematical model for AI languages such as [`bluer-ai`](https://github.com/kamangir/bluer-ai) and [its ecosystem](https://github.com/kamangir/bluer-south). This model is described in the working paper "[Access, Automation, Analytics, AI](https://github.com/kamangir/giza/blob/main/pdf/giza.pdf)" [[tex](https://github.com/kamangir/giza/blob/main/tex/giza.tex)].
