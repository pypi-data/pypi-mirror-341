# Swipe Verse

A multiverse card-based decision game built with Python and Flet.

## Overview

Swipe Verse is a theme-based card decision game where players navigate different realities by swiping left or right on cards, managing various resources to succeed across multiple thematic universes. Originally inspired by "Reigns", the game has evolved into a multiverse of interconnected experiences, from medieval kingdoms to corporate boardrooms and beyond. Built using Flet, a Python framework for cross-platform applications.

## Features

- **Card-based gameplay** similar to "Reigns"
- **Resource management** system with visual indicators
- **Data-driven approach** with game content loaded from JSON configuration files
- **Cross-platform support** for desktop, mobile, and web
- **Mobile-first responsive design** that works on any screen size
- **Customizable themes** and visual filters

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swipe-verse.git
cd swipe-verse

# Install with pip
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the game with default settings
swipe-verse

# Run with a custom configuration file
swipe-verse --config path/to/config.json

## Game Configuration

The game is data-driven and can be customized by editing JSON configuration files. Multiple theme configurations are available in the `swipe_verse/config/` directory:
