OSIRIS_UTILS
============
|Pypi|

This package contains a set of utilities to open and analyze OSIRIS output files, using Python. All the methods implemented are fully integrated with `NumPy`, and use `np.ndarray` as the main data structure.
High-level functions are provided to manipulate data from OSIRIS, from reading the data of the diagnostics, to making post-processing calculations.

All code is written in Python. To contact the dev team, please send an email to Jo찾o Biu: `joaopedrofbiu@tecnico.ulisboa.pt <mailto:joaopedrofbiu@tecnico.ulisboa.pt>`_.
