# SGSIM
<p align="justify">
<strong>SGSIM</strong> is a Python package for simulating target earthquake ground motions using a site-based stochastic model [1]. It derives model parameters that implicitly account for the earthquake and site characteristics of the target ground motion. Using these parameters, the package simulates ground motions for the specific earthquake scenario, accounting for their aleatoric variability. It also provides tools for visualizing the simulation results..

## Features
- **Site-based Stochastic Modeling**: Configure and fit the stochastic model to ground motion data with customizable parameters.  
- **Simulation**: Simulate ground motion time series, Fourier and response spectra, and other properties rapidly. The results can be saved in csv files.
- **Visualization**: Plot ground motion data, Fourier and response spectra, and other properties to verify and validate simulations.
