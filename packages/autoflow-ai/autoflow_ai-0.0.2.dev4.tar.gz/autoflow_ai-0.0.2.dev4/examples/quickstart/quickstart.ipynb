TiKV and TiFlash can be deployed on different machines as needed to solve the problem of HTAP resource isolation.\\n\\n- **Cloud-native distributed database**\\n\\n  TiDB is a distributed database designed for the cloud, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on the cloud platform.

This guarantees strong consistency and availability when a minority of replicas go down. You can configure the geographic location and number of replicas as needed to meet different disaster tolerance levels.\\n\\n- **Real-time HTAP**\\n\\n  TiDB provides two storage engines: [TiKV](/tikv-overview.md), a row-based storage engine, and [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md), a columnar storage engine. \\n\\n  TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. TiKV and TiFlash can be deployed on different machines as needed to solve the problem of HTAP resource isolation.\\n\\n- **Cloud-native distributed database**\\n\\n  TiDB is a distributed database designed for the cloud, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on the cloud platform. Users can elastically scale TiDB to meet the requirements of their changing workloads.  \n",
