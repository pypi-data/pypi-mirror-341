def cchecksum(str norm_address_no_0x, const unsigned char[::1] address_hash_hex_no_0x) -> str:
    """
    Computes the checksummed version of an Ethereum address.

    This function takes a normalized Ethereum address (without the '0x' prefix) and its corresponding
    hash (also without the '0x' prefix) and returns the checksummed address as per the Ethereum
    Improvement Proposal 55 (EIP-55).

    Args:
        norm_address_no_0x: The normalized Ethereum address without the '0x' prefix.
        address_hash_hex_no_0x: The hash of the address, also without the '0x' prefix.

    Returns:
        The checksummed Ethereum address with the '0x' prefix.

    Examples:
        >>> cchecksum("b47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb", "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12")
        '0xB47E3Cd837DdF8E4C57F05D70Ab865De6E193BbB'

        >>> cchecksum("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678")
        '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
