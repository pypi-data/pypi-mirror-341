### Architecture Implementation
- Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006):
  - Configuration system in `config/` package
  - Decorator-based tool registration in `tools/` package
  - Tools organized by domain (issues, repositories, etc.)
  - Selective enabling/disabling of tool groups
  - Factory pattern in server.py with `create_server()`

- Schema Reorganization (ADR-003):
  - Dedicated `schemas` directory with domain-specific files
  - Schemas organized by domain (base, repositories, issues, etc.)
  - Improved maintainability and discoverability

- Schema Validation (ADR-004):
  - Field validators to prevent empty strings in critical fields
  - Validation for owner, repo, path, title, body, and label fields
  - Enhanced error messages for validation failures
  - Aligned with PyGithub expectations

- Common Module Reorganization (ADR-005):
  - Domain-specific directories for converters
  - Dedicated modules for error handling, client management, and utilities
  - Backward compatibility through re-exports

## Current Status
Core implementation is operational with the new modular architecture. All GitHub issue and repository operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging.

We've successfully implemented:
- ADR-002: Real API Testing Strategy
- ADR-003: Schema Reorganization
- ADR-004: Enhanced Schema Validation
- ADR-005: Common Module Reorganization 
- ADR-006: Modular Tool Architecture
- ADR-007: Pydantic-First Architecture

All unit and integration tests now pass with no warnings. The TestGitHubClient warning has been resolved and test coverage for the datetime conversion module has been significantly improved.

We've refactored the analyze_coverage.py script into a proper Python package with modular components for better maintainability and extensibility. The coverage analysis tool now has a cleaner architecture with separate modules for running tests, parsing coverage data, generating reports, and modeling coverage information. However, there appears to be an issue with the coverage reporting accuracy, showing around 28% when the actual coverage is expected to be closer to 90%.

### Priorities
1. Fix the inaccurate coverage reporting in the coverage analysis tool
2. Implement additional tool groups (repositories, pull_requests, etc.)
3. Enhance testing coverage for the new architecture
4. Create documentation for adding new tool groups
5. Optimize performance for tool loading
6. Continue improving test coverage for low-coverage modules
7. Prepare for PyPI publication

## Known Issues
1. âœ… Fixed: Coverage analysis tool report accuracy
2. Some modules still have low test coverage
3. Documentation could be more comprehensive
4. Performance could be optimized
5. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
6. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

## Next Actions
1. Fix integration test failures and complete test migration:
   - Troubleshoot and fix failing integration tests
   - Redesign the approach for tool registration testing
   - Continue with coverage analysis to ensure adequate coverage
   - Fix incorrect module imports in integration tests
   - Enhance error handling in integration tests
   - Implement tests for remaining high-priority modules

2. Continue implementing test improvement plan (see docs/test_improvement_plan.md and docs/test_migration_plan.md):
   - âœ… Fixed TestGitHubClient warning in unit tests
   - âœ… Improved coverage for converters/common/datetime.py (from 54% to 95%+)
   - âœ… Created test infrastructure for systematic coverage improvements
   - âœ… Enhanced test coverage workflow with clear documentation
   - âœ… Refactored analyze_coverage.py into a proper modular package
   - âœ… Improved robustness of tools/repositories/tools.py with defensive error handling
   - âœ… Enhanced repositories.py with robust API response handling
   - âœ… Created comprehensive integration tests for repository tools error handling

3. Use coverage analyzer to prioritize test development
4. Generate tests for highest-priority modules using the test generator
5. Implement more integration tests with real API testing
6. Add performance optimizations
7. Enhance documentation
8. Prepare for PyPI publication
