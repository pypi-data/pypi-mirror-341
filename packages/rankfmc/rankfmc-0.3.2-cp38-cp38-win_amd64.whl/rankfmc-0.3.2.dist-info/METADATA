### Describe
RankFM is a python implementation of the general [Factorization Machines](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf) model class adapted for collaborative filtering recommendation/ranking problems with implicit feedback user/item interaction data. It uses [Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2618.pdf) and a variant of [Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.587.3946&rep=rep1&type=pdf) loss to learn model weights via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It can (optionally) incorporate sample weights and user/item auxiliary features to augment the main interaction data.

The core (training, prediction, recommendation) methods are written in [Cython](https://cython.org/), making it possible to scale to millions of user/item interactions. Designed for ease-of-use, RankFM accepts both `pd.DataFrame` and `np.ndarray` inputs - you do not have to convert your data to `scipy.sparse` matrices or re-map user/item identifiers prior to use. RankFM internally maps all user/item identifiers to zero-based integer indexes, but always converts its output back to the original user/item identifiers from your data, which can be arbitrary (non-zero-based, non-consecutive) integers or even strings.

In addition to the familiar `fit()`, `predict()`, `recommend()` methods, RankFM includes additional utilities `similiar_users()` and `similar_items()` to find the most similar users/items to a given user/item based on latent factor space embeddings. A number of popular recommendation/ranking evaluation metric functions have been included in the separate `evaluation` module to streamline model tuning and validation.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.8+
* numpy >= 1.15
* pandas >= 0.24

### Installation

You can install the latest published version from PyPI using `pip`:
```
pip install rankfmc
```
Or alternatively install the current development build directly from GitHub:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ErraticO/rankfmc.git
```

### Quickstart
Let's work through a simple example of fitting a model, generating recommendations, evaluating performance, and assessing some item-item similarities. The data we'll be using here may already be somewhat familiar: you know it, you love it, it's the [MovieLens 1M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)!

Let's first look at the required shape of the interaction data:

| user_id | item_id |
|---------|---------|
| 3       | 233     |
| 5       | 377     |
| 8       | 610     |

It has just two columns: a `user_id` and an `item_id` (you can name these fields whatever you want or use a numpy array instead). Notice that there is no `rating` column - this library is for **implicit feedback** data (e.g. watches, page views, purchases, clicks) as opposed to **explicit feedback** data (e.g. 1-5 ratings, thumbs up/down). Implicit feedback is far more common in real-world recommendation contexts and doesn't suffer from the [missing-not-at-random problem](https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-01-24-RecSysLDN-Ravelin.pdf) of pure explicit feedback approaches.

Now let's import the library, initialize our model, and fit on the training data:
```python
from rankfmc import RankFM
model = RankFM(factors=20, loss='warp', max_samples=20, alpha=0.01, sigma=0.1, learning_rate=0.1, learning_schedule='invscaling')
model.fit(interactions_train, epochs=20, verbose=True)
# NOTE: this takes about 30 seconds for 750,000 interactions on my 2.3 GHz i5 8GB RAM MacBook
```
If you set `verbose=True` the model will print the current epoch number as well as the epoch's log-likelihood during training. This can be useful to gauge both computational speed and training gains by epoch. If the log likelihood is not increasing then try upping the `learning_rate` or lowering the (`alpha`, `beta`) regularization strength terms. If the log likelihood is starting to bounce up and down try lowering the `learning_rate` or using `learning_schedule='invscaling'` to decrease the learning rate over time. If you run into overflow errors then decrease the feature and/or sample-weight magnitudes and try upping `beta`, especially if you have a small number of dense user-features and/or item-features. Selecting `BPR` loss will lead to faster training times, but `WARP` loss typically yields superior model performance.

Now let's generate some user-item model scores from the validation data:
```python
valid_scores = model.predict(interactions_valid, cold_start='nan')
```
this will produce an array of real-valued model scores generated using the Factorization Machines model equation. You can interpret it as a measure of the predicted utility of item (i) for user (u). The `cold_start='nan'` option can be used to set scores to `np.nan` for user/item pairs not found in the training data, or `cold_start='drop'` can be specified to drop those pairs so the results contain no missing values.

Now let's generate our topN recommended movies for each user:
```python
valid_recs = model.recommend(valid_users, n_items=10, filter_previous=True, cold_start='drop')
```
The input should be a `pd.Series`, `np.ndarray` or `list` of `user_id` values. You can use `filter_previous=True` to prevent generating recommendations that include any items observed by the user in the training data, which could be useful depending on your application context. The result will be a `pd.DataFrame` where `user_id` values will be the index and the rows will be each user's top recommended items in descending order (best item is in column 0):

|   |    0|    1|    2|    3|    4|    5|    6|    7|   8|    9|
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|
|3  | 2396| 1265|  357|   34| 2858| 3175|    1| 2028|  17|  356|
|5  |  608| 1617| 1610| 3418|  590|  474|  858|  377| 924| 1036|
|8  |  589| 1036| 2571| 2028| 2000| 1220| 1197|  110| 780| 1954|

Now let's see how the model is performing wrt the included validation metrics evaluated on the hold-out data:
```python
from rankfmc.evaluation import hit_rate, reciprocal_rank, discounted_cumulative_gain, precision, recall

valid_hit_rate = hit_rate(model, interactions_valid, k=10)
valid_reciprocal_rank = reciprocal_rank(model, interactions_valid, k=10)
valid_dcg = discounted_cumulative_gain(model, interactions_valid, k=10)
valid_precision = precision(model, interactions_valid, k=10)
valid_recall = recall(model, interactions_valid, k=10)
```
```
hit_rate: 0.796
reciprocal_rank: 0.339
dcg: 0.734
precision: 0.159
recall: 0.077
```
