# Grok3API: Client for Working with Grok 🤖

---

## [📦 Changelog](docs/En/ChangeLog.md)

### 🆕 v0.0.1b11

#### ✨ New:
- 🖼️ **Support for sending images to Grok**  
  It's now much easier to send images to the Grok server! A detailed description of the sending method is available [here](docs/En/askDoc.md).

- 🤖 **Work continues on OpenAI-compatible server**  
  - ✅ Now **any `api_key`** is supported for working with the server.
  - ⚙️ Added the ability to configure the server (via command-line arguments and environment variables). A detailed guide on how to run the server is available in [🌐 Running the OpenAI-Compatible Server](docs/En/OpenAI_Server.md).

> ⚠️ **The server is still in early stages, and some features may be unstable.**

**Grok3API** is a powerful and convenient unofficial client for interacting with Grok models (including Grok3), allowing you to send requests, receive text responses, and, most notably, **generated images** — all with automatic cookie management! 🎨✨ The project is designed with a focus on ease of use and automation, so you can concentrate on creativity rather than technical details.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🚀 **Automatic cookie retrieval** via browser with bypassing Cloudflare — no manual setup required!
- 🖼️ **Convenient retrieval of generated images** with the `save_to` method, enabling you to save them with a single click.
- 🔧 **Flexible request configuration**: model selection, image generation management, attachment addition, and more.
- 📦 **Attachment support**: send files and images along with your requests.
- 🛠️ **Error handling**: the client itself solves problems with cookies and repeats requests if something goes wrong.
- 🤖 **[Telegram bot example](tests/SimpleTgBot/SimpleTgBot.py) (`grok3api` + `aiogram`)**, with the ability to create text replies and images.

## 📦 Installation

To start using Grok3API, install the necessary dependencies. It’s simple:

```bash
pip install grok3api
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Ensure you have **Google Chrome** installed, as `undetected_chromedriver` works specifically with it.

After installing, you’re ready to begin! 🎉

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

Here’s a complete example of how to send a request and save a generated image:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  # Create a client (cookies will be automatically retrieved if not present)
  client = GrokClient()

  # Create a request
  message = "Create an image of a ship"

  # Send the request
  result = client.ask(message=message,
                      images="C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\photo.jpg") # if you want to send a picture to Grok
  
  print("Grok's response:", result.modelResponse.message)

  # Save the first image if available
  if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
    result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("ship.jpg")
    print("Image saved as ship.jpg! 🚀")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code:
1. Creates a client (cookies are fetched automatically if absent).
2. Sends a request to generate an image.
3. Saves the result to the file `ship.jpg`.

**📌 What will we see?**  
Grok will generate an image of a **ship**, for example, something like this:  

<img src="assets/ship.jpg" alt="Example spaceship" width="500">

🐹 Or, for example, you ask for "**Gopher on Elbrus**":

<img src="assets/gopher.jpg" alt="Example spaceship" width="500">

> 💡 **Tip**: You don’t need to manually obtain cookies — the client handles it for you!

## 🔧 Request Parameters

The `GrokCLient.ask` method accepts numerous parameters to customize your request. Here’s an example with settings:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  # Create a client (cookies will be automatically retrieved if not present)
  client = GrokClient(history_msg_count=5)
  client.history.set_main_system_prompt("Answer briefly and with emoji.")

  # Send a request with settings
  result = client.ask(
    message="Draw a cat like in the picture",
    modelName="grok-3",  # Default is grok-3
    images=["C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\photo1_to_grok.jpg",
            "C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\photo2_to_grok.jpg"] # You can send many images to grok!
  )
  print(f"Grok3's response: {result.modelResponse.message}")

  # Save all images
  for i, img in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
    img.save_to(f"cat_{i}.jpg")
    print(f"Saved: cat_{i}.jpg 🐾")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

## 🖼️ Convenient Image Handling

One of the standout features of GrokClient is its **super-convenient handling of generated images**. Here’s a complete example:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  # Create a client
  client = GrokClient()

  # Send a request
  result = client.ask("Draw a sunset over the sea")

  # Save all images
  for i, image in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
    image.save_to(f"sunset_{i}.jpg")
    print(f"Saved: sunset_{i}.jpg 🌅")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

> 🌟 **Cool Fact**: This works with automatically retrieved cookies! You don’t need to worry about access — the client sets everything up for you.
 
 ---
 
 ## 🔄 Automatic Cookie Retrieval
 
 If cookies are missing or outdated, GrokClient automatically:
 1. Uses a Chrome browser (ensure it’s installed).
 2. Visits `https://grok.com/`.
 3. Bypasses Cloudflare protection.
 4. Will continue to work.
 
 You don’t need to do anything manually — just run the code, and it will work!

## 📋 Response Processing

The `ask` method returns a `GrokResponse` object. Here’s an example of working with it:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  
  # Create a client
  client = GrokClient()

  # Send a request
  result = client.ask("Describe and draw a forest")

  # Process the response
  print(f"Text: {result.modelResponse.message}")
  if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
    result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("forest.jpg")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

**Fields of the `GrokResponse` object:**
- **`modelResponse`**: The main model response.
  - `message` (str): The text response.
  - `generatedImages` (List[GeneratedImage]): List of images.
- **`isThinking`**: Whether the model was thinking (bool).
- **`isSoftStop`**: Soft stop (bool).
- **`responseId`**: Response ID (str).
- **`newTitle`**: New chat title, if available (Optional[str]).
