# Grok3API: Client for Working with Grok ü§ñ

---

## üì¶ Changelog

### üÜï v0.0.1b10

#### ‚ú® New:
- üîê **Automatic cookie retrieval**  
  It is now **no longer required to manually provide cookies** ‚Äî the client will automatically retrieve them if needed.  
  ‚ûï However, you **can still provide your own cookies** if you want to use your account (e.g., for generation with custom settings or access to premium features).

- ü§ñ **Started work on OpenAI compatibility** ([**server.py**](grok3api/server.py), [**Demo**](tests/openai_test.py))
  The initial draft of OpenAI API compatibility server has been implemented. It **kind of works**, but:  
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **It's in a very early stage and completely unpolished. Use at your own risk!**

---

**Grok3API** is a powerful and convenient unofficial client for interacting with Grok models (including Grok3), allowing you to send requests, receive text responses, and, most notably, **generated images** ‚Äî all with automatic cookie management! üé®‚ú® The project is designed with a focus on ease of use and automation, so you can concentrate on creativity rather than technical details.

---

## üåü Features

- üöÄ **Automatic cookie retrieval** via browser with bypassing Cloudflare ‚Äî no manual setup required!
- üñºÔ∏è **Convenient retrieval of generated images** with the `save_to` method, enabling you to save them with a single click.
- üîß **Flexible request configuration**: model selection, image generation management, attachment addition, and more.
- üì¶ **Attachment support**: send files and images along with your requests.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Error handling**: the client itself solves problems with cookies and repeats requests if something goes wrong.
- ü§ñ **[Telegram bot example](tests/SimpleTgBot/SimpleTgBot.py) (`grok3api` + `aiogram`)**, with the ability to create text replies and images.

## üì¶ Installation

To start using Grok3API, install the necessary dependencies. It‚Äôs simple:

```bash
pip install grok3api
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Ensure you have **Google Chrome** installed, as `undetected_chromedriver` works specifically with it.

After installing, you‚Äôre ready to begin! üéâ

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start

Here‚Äôs a complete example of how to send a request and save a generated image:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  
  # You can add a list of strings/dictionaries to automatically change when the limit is reached
  #client = GrokClient(cookies="YOUR_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER")
  
  # Create a client (cookies will be automatically retrieved if not present)
  client = GrokClient()

  # Create a request
  message = "Create an image of a ship"

  # Send the request
  result = client.ask(message)
  print("Grok's response:", result.modelResponse.message)

  # Save the first image if available
  if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
    result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("ship.jpg")
    print("Image saved as ship.jpg! üöÄ")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

This code:
1. Creates a client (cookies are fetched automatically if absent).
2. Sends a request to generate an image.
3. Saves the result to the file `ship.jpg`.

**üìå What will we see?**  
Grok will generate an image of a **ship**, for example, something like this:  

<img src="assets/ship.jpg" alt="Example spaceship" width="500">

> üí° **Tip**: You don‚Äôt need to manually obtain cookies ‚Äî the client handles it for you!

---

## üîß Request Parameters

The `GrokCLient.ask` method accepts numerous parameters to customize your request. Here‚Äôs an example with settings:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  # Create a client
  client = GrokClient()

  # Send a request with settings
  result = client.ask(
    message="Draw a cat",
    modelName="grok-3",  # Default is grok-3
    imageGenerationCount=2,  # I want 2 cat image!
  )
  print(f"Grok3's response: {result.modelResponse.message}")

  # Save all images
  for i, img in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
    img.save_to(f"cat_{i}.jpg")
    print(f"Saved: cat_{i}.jpg üêæ")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

## üñºÔ∏è Convenient Image Handling

One of the standout features of GrokClient is its **super-convenient handling of generated images**. Here‚Äôs a complete example:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  # Create a client
  client = GrokClient()

  # Send a request
  result = client.ask("Draw a sunset over the sea")

  # Save all images
  for i, image in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
    image.save_to(f"sunset_{i}.jpg")
    print(f"Saved: sunset_{i}.jpg üåÖ")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

> üåü **Cool Fact**: This works with automatically retrieved cookies! You don‚Äôt need to worry about access ‚Äî the client sets everything up for you.
 
 ---
 
 ## üîÑ Automatic Cookie Retrieval
 
 If cookies are missing or outdated, GrokClient automatically:
 1. Uses a Chrome browser (ensure it‚Äôs installed).
 2. Visits `https://grok.com/`.
 3. Bypasses Cloudflare protection.
 4. Will continue to work.
 
 You don‚Äôt need to do anything manually ‚Äî just run the code, and it will work!


---

## üìã Response Processing

The `ask` method returns a `GrokResponse` object. Here‚Äôs an example of working with it:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
  
  # Create a client
  client = GrokClient()

  # Send a request
  result = client.ask("Describe and draw a forest")

  # Process the response
  print(f"Text: {result.modelResponse.message}")
  if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
    result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("forest.jpg")


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

**Fields of the `GrokResponse` object:**
- **`modelResponse`**: The main model response.
  - `message` (str): The text response.
  - `generatedImages` (List[GeneratedImage]): List of images.
- **`isThinking`**: Whether the model was thinking (bool).
- **`isSoftStop`**: Soft stop (bool).
- **`responseId`**: Response ID (str).
- **`newTitle`**: New chat title, if available (Optional[str]).
