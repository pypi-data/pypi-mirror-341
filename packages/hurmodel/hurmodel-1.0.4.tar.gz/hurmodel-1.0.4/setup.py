# THIS IS AN EXTENSION NETWORK OF THE SKILLS OF THE HURNET ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
# The HurModel (Hur of HurNet and Model of language model) is a sophisticated artificial neural network computational algorithm that proposes a new architecture for language models based on Transformers.
# This architecture uses aspects already known from Transformers applied to GPT models, such as normalizers, tokenizers, embeddings and attention mechanisms,
# but adds new concepts such as intelligent initialization of weights using layers of the HurNet network, insertion of auxiliary HurNet layers and use of HurNet networks in the final adjustment of weights.
# As an integral part of the architecture, HurModel models do not require hyperparameter configurations, since this can be done completely autonomously without developer intervention,
# allowing the programmer to focus only on the data that is the most important part of the model. All these features make the HurModel language model architecture superior to the already known GPT models.
