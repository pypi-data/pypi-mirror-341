# What you'll learn
These examples assume you want to interactively build a dashboard using a python script or the terminal. On this page, I'll show how to use `{powerbpy}` to create a new dashboard, add pages to the dashboard, and visual elements such as maps and charts to the pages. To view dashboards you'll need a copy of Power BI desktop and therfore using Windows.    
   
# Setup    
## Install dependencies
1. Install python        
You'll need to install python. Here are some <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-python-3-latest-version/">instructions</a>    
2. Install Power Bpy    
The `{powerbpy}` package isn't on pypi yet, so you'll need to install it from github. <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089">Open a terminal</a> and enter the following:     
    
```dosbat     
py -m pip install git+https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy.git#egg=powerbpy     
```     
   
After the package is on pypi, you'll be able to install it using this: 
```batchfile
py -m pip install powerbpy
```
   
## Executing python scripts   
That's all you need to install! To create the dashboards, you'll need to either run the commands in a terminal, or use a text editor to save the commands in a a script. I recomend starting with a text editor, because as your dashboard grows more complex, it'll be helpful to have everything saved in a script. Many text editors have an option to execute a script directly from the editor. You can also execute the scripts from the terminal using the following command:     
```dosbat
py build_dashboard.py
```  
This assumes that you named your script `build_dashboard.py` and the command prompt's current directory is the folder storing `build_dashboard.py`. You can change the current directory of the terminal using the `cd` command. For example you can use the following to move into `C:/Users/`:     
```dosbat
cd C:/Users/
```
You can also use full or relative paths from the current directory to the python script without changing the current working directory. For example if you start in your `%userprofile%` (`C:/Users/[your username]`) and the python script is stored at `C:/Users/[your username]/python_projects/build_dashboard.py`, you can execute the script with the following:     
```dosbat      
py python_projects/build_dashboard.py    
```    

# Build dashboards   
## Create a new dashboard
To Create a new dashboard, you'll need to provide two arguments:      
1. parent_dir - This is the folder where you want to store your dashboard     
2. report_name - This is the name you want to give your dashboard project.       
     
If you want to create a dashboard called `bigfoots` in a folder called `C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects`,  here's what the code should look like    
```python    
# Import the package
import powerbpy as PBI


PBI.create_new_dashboard(report_location = "C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects", report_name = "bigfoots")



# Create a new dashboard -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PBI_dash.create_new_dashboard(report_location, report_name)    
```     
If everything worked, the function should have created the following files:     
![image](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/blob/main/docs/assets/images/new_dashboard_filetree.png?raw=true)       
    
You can open the `bigfoots.pbip` file in Power BI desktop normally. (Although you will probably need to turn on <a href="https://russell-shean.github.io/powerbpy/#dependencies">these preview features</a>. )
