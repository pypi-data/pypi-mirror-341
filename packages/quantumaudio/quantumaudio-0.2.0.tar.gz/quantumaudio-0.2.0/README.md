## üíø What is Quantum Audio ?

Quantum audio refers to the application of principles from quantum mechanics to the creation, processing, and analysis of sound or audio signals. 

> Here, the information is processed using <i>quantum bits</i>, or <i>qubits</i>, instead of classical bits (0s and 1s).
> Unlike classical bits which can only be in one state at a time, _qubits_ can exist in multiple states at once until they are measured.

#### New Paradigm üéµ

Audio plays a vital role in carrying information and music, traversing through domains ‚Äî from **Analog** and **Digital** formats to engaging our senses in a profound way. With the advent of Quantum Computing, **Quantum Audio** formulate ways of representing Audio in the Quantum Domain, enabling new explorations in artistic and research contexts üí´

#### The Package üì¶

The `quantumaudio` package provides fundamental operations for representing audio samples as Quantum States that can be processed on a Quantum computer (or a Simulator) and played back üîä

```python
quantumaudio.encode(audio)   # returns a quantum circuit
quantumaudio.decode(circuit) # returns audio samples
```

>  Quantum Audio represents Audio in terms of Quantum Circuits and does not require Quantum Memory for storage.

### Migration Guide
If you're transitioning from the previous version, please check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/blob/main/docs/guides/MIGRATION.md) for an overview of the package usability.


##  ü™Ñ Installation <a id="installation"></a>
To install the Quantum Audio Package, you can use ```pip``` (included with Python) which installs it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantumaudio/) package manager. Run the following command in Terminal or Command Prompt: 
```console
pip install quantumaudio
```
For local installation by [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), navigate to the cloned directory in Terminal or Command Prompt and run:<br>
```pip install .``` or  ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>

> [!Note]
 > When using `pip` commands to install packages and dependencies, it's recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep them isolated from the system's Python. This will avoid any dependency conflicts. Instructions on using a virtual environment are provided [here](https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/blob/main/docs/guides/ENVIRONMENT.md).

### Optional Dependencies
All additional dependencies required that support the demos provided in the repository can be installed using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install "quantumaudio[demos]"
  ```
It includes the following collection of dependencies, also mentioned in the folder ``demos/requirements``:

  - **Digital Audio Dependencies**
    The core package operates with _numpy_ arrays. Dependencies for audio file handling to run audio examples in notebook and scripts in the repository can be separately installed using ```pip install soundfile==0.12.1 librosa==0.10.2.post1```
  
> [!Tip]
> If using your own choice of libraries for digital audio processing, please be aware that Multi-channel Quantum Audio is processed with _Channels First_ data structure. e.g. `(2, N)` for a Stereo Audio of `N` samples.
  
  - **Notebook Dependencies**
    The [Demo Notebook](https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/blob/main/demos/1_Basics_Walkthrough.ipynb) features interactive elements that require additional dependency. It can be installed using ```pip install ipywidgets```


## üéõÔ∏è Usage <a id="usage"></a>

### Using Schemes
Get started on creating Quantum Audio Representations with just a few lines of code.
```python
# An instance of a scheme can be created using:
import quantumaudio
qpam = quantumaudio.load_scheme("qpam") # or directly access from quantumaudio.schemes.QPAM()

# Define an Input
original_data = quantumaudio.tools.test_signal() # for a random array of samples (range: -1.0 to 1.0)

# Encoding
encoded_circuit = qpam.encode(original_data)

# ... optionally do some analysis or processing

# Decoding
decoded_data  = qpam.decode(encoded_circuit,shots=4000)    
```

> [!Note]
> The `encode` function returns a circuit with attached classical measurements by default. In Qiskit, it is not possible to directly modify a circuit after these measurements are added. If you wish to return a circuit without measurements, you can specify `measure=False` while encoding.

### Using Functions
The core functions are also directly accessible without declaring a Scheme object. (Refer to [Documentation](https://quantumaudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/quantumaudio.html#top-level-functions) for all the available functions)
```python
circuit = quantumaudio.encode(data, scheme="qpam")
decoded_data = quantumaudio.decode(circuit)
```
Here, any remaining arguments can be passed as keywords e.g. ```quantumaudio.encode(data, scheme="qsm", measure="False")```.

> [!Note]
> The circuit depth can grow complex for a long array of samples which is the case with Digital Audio. It is optimal to represent a short length of samples per Circuit when using the `encode()` method.<br>

### Working with Digital Audio
For faster processing of longer arrays, the `stream` method is preferred. 
```python
quantumaudio.stream(data)
```
It wraps the functions provided in the module `quantumaudio.tools.stream` that help process large arrays as chunks for efficient handling. Examples of its usage can be found in the [Demos](https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/tree/main/demos) provided in the repository.

### Running on Native Backends

A Scheme's ```decode()``` method uses local [_AerSimulator_](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer) as the default backend. Internally, the function calls `utils.execute()` method that performs ```backend.run()```. Any such backend object compatible with Qiskit can be passed to the ```backend=``` parameter of the `decode()` function. To configure this further or to use primitives, please refer to custom [execute functions](#custom_functions).

### Running on External Quantum Backends

The package allows flexible use of Quantum Hardware from different Providers as the execution of circuits can be done independently. Depending on the results, there are two ways to decode quantum audio:

- **Results Object:** If the result obtained follow the format of [qiskit.result.Result](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Result) or [qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult),
  - The audio can be decoded with ```scheme.decode_result(result_object)``` method.
  - In this case, relevant metadata information is automatically extracted and applied at decoding. It can also be manually passed using `metadata=` parameter.
<br><br>
- **Counts Dictionary:** If the result is in form of a counts dictionary or [qiskit.result.Counts](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Counts) object,
  - The audio can be decoded using ```scheme.decode_counts(counts, metadata)``` method.
  - Here, the metadata dictionary is required which can be obtained from the encoded circuit's `.metadata` attribute.
    
> [!Tip]
> **Dictionaries** are data type in python to store {key : _value_} pairs.
> - **Counts Dicitonary** contains keys representing classical measurement outcomes and values indicating the number of times the outcome was observed. Example: `{'00': 77, '01': 79, '10': 84, '11': 72}`.
> - **Metadata Dictionary** stores the key information that is required at decoding, which is commonly the original data dimensions to restore and layout of qubits. Both can be obtained from `scheme.calculate()` method.

### Viewing Metadata
The Metadata Information can be viewed from the encoded circuit's `.metadata` attribute. The common keys found in a metadata are: 
 - **num_samples** (_int_) : Original sample length to restore.
 - **num_channels** (_int_): Original number of channels to restore. (Applicable for multi-channel schemes)
 - **qubit_shape** (_tuple_): Stores the arrangement and number of qubits that encode each aspect of the audio information i.e. _Time_, _Channel_ (if applicable) and _Amplitude_. <br>

The _QPAM_ scheme's encoding only preserves **num_samples** (_int_) and the normalization factor - **norm_factor** (_float_) which is required to restore the values.
> [!Note]
> When passing metadata manually in any of the decode functions, _QPAM_ Scheme additionaly requires **shots** (_int_) information used for executing the circuit which can also be passed through the argument `shots=`.

> [!Tip]
> The essential keys required for decoding with any scheme can be checked from the scheme's `.keys` attribute.

### Using Custom Functions <a id="custom_functions"></a>
The `decode` and `stream` operations can be configured with the following custom functions. They require few mandatory arguments followed by custom preceding keyword arguments (denoted as `**kwargs`).
- **Process Function**:
The default process function of `stream()` simply encodes and decodes a chunk of data with default parameters. It can be overriden by passing a custom function to the `process_function=` parameter. The mandatory arguments for the custom process function are `data=` and `scheme=`.
```python
processed_data = process_function(data, scheme, **kwargs)
```
- **Execute Function** :
The default execute function for `decode()` can be overriden by passing a custom function to the `execute_function=` parameter. The mandatory argument for the custom execute function is `circuit=`. (QPAM also expects `shots=` since it's a metadata)
```python
result = execute_function(circuit, **kwargs)
``` 
**Example**: An optional execute function is included in the package which uses [Sampler Primitive](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2): `quantumaudio.utils.execute_with_sampler` that can be passed to the `decode()` method. It requires the dependency `pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime`. <br>
