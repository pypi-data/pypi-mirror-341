## DATAIDEA Quickstart

### What is the `dataidea` package?

This is a package we are currently developing to help new and old data analysists walk around some repetitive and sometimes disturbing tasks that a data analyst does day to day

This library currently extends and depends on majorly numpy, pandas as sklearn and these, among a few others will be installed once you install dataidea

## Installing `dataidea`

- To install dataidea, you must have python installed on your machine
- It's advised that you install it in a virtual environment
- You can install `dataidea` using the command below

```python
pip install dataidea
```

### Learning `dataidea`

The best way to get started with dataidea (and data analysis) is to complete the free course.

To see whatâ€™s possible with dataidea, take a look at the Quick Start

Read through the [Tutorials](https://docs.dataidea.org) to learn how to load datasets, train your own models on your own datasets. Use the navigation to look through the dataidea documentation. Every class, function, and method is documented.
