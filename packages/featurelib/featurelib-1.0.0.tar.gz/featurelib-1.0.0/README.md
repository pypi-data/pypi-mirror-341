Featurelib is a python library containing a collection of carefully designed tools for separating functionality from the main underlying class. It allows creation of Feature classes that are typically different than any normal class in python. A Feature class contains a partial implementation which will then be inherited by the main class for it access it. This severely changes the game-plan for maintaining relatively larger projects by increasing readability and decreasing clutter and at the same time providing a better view over future updates and extensibility.
