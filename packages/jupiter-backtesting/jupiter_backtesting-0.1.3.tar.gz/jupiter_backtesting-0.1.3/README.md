# Jupiter 🪐

**A lightweight extension for [`vectorbt`](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) focused on statistical robustness, modularity, and clean strategy integration.**

Jupiter makes it easy to design strategies, analyze them in depth, and validate results with advanced statistical techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Clean `Strategy` base class for building reusable strategies
- ✅ `Analyzer` with detailed performance metrics  
  (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, volatility, drawdown, etc.)
- ✅ Time-based train/test split with purge window
- ✅ Built-in `hyperopt` integration for parameter optimization
- ✅ Modular structure – easy to extend, simple to use

## 🔬 Coming Soon

- 🧠 Walk-forward optimization (rolling/expanding windows)
- 🎲 Monte Carlo simulations  
  (bootstrapping, signal permutation, resampling)
- 📊 Sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters
- 🧩 Strategy templates and advanced features
