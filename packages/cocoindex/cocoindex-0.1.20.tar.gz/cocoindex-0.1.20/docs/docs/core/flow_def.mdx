# CocoIndex Flow Definition

In CocoIndex, to define an indexing flow, you provide a function to import source, transform data and put them into target storage (sinks).
You connect input/output of these operations with fields of data scopes.

## Entry Point

A CocoIndex flow is defined by a function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

The easiest way is to use the `@cocoindex.flow_def` decorator:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    ...
```

This `@cocoindex.flow_def` decorator declares this function as a CocoIndex flow definition.

It takes two arguments:

*   `flow_builder`: a `FlowBuilder` object to help build the flow.
*   `data_scope`: a `DataScope` object, representing the top-level data scope. Any data created by the flow should be added to it.

Alternatively, for more flexibility (e.g. you want to do this conditionally or generate dynamic name), you can explicitly call the `cocoindex.add_flow_def()` method:

```python
def demo_flow_def(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    ...

# Add the flow definition to the flow registry.
demo_flow = cocoindex.flow.add_flow_def("DemoFlow", demo_flow_def)
```

In both cases, `demo_flow` will be an object with `cocoindex.Flow` class type.
See [Flow Running](/docs/core/flow_methods) for more details on it.

</Tabs>

## Flow Builder

The `FlowBuilder` object is the starting point to construct a flow.

### Import from source

`FlowBuilder` provides a `add_source()` method to import data from external sources.
A *source spec* needs to be provided for any import operation, to describe the source and parameters related to the source.
Import must happen at the top level, and the field created by import must be in the top-level struct.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(DemoSourceSpec(...))
    ......
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

`add_source()` returns a `DataSlice`. Once external data sources are imported, you can further transform them using methods exposed by these data objects, as discussed in the following sections.

We'll describe different data objects in next few sections.

:::note

The actual value of data is not available at the time when we define the flow: it's only available at runtime.
In a flow definition, you can use a data representation as input for operations, but not access the actual value.

:::

#### Refresh interval

You can provide a `refresh_interval` argument.
When present, in the [live update mode](/docs/core/flow_methods#live-update), the data source will be refreshed by specified interval.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

The `refresh_interval` argument is of type `datetime.timedelta`. For example, this refreshes the data source every 1 minute:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(
        DemoSourceSpec(...), refresh_interval=datetime.timedelta(minutes=1))
    ......
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

In live update mode, for each refresh, CocoIndex will traverse the data source to figure out the changes,
and only perform transformations on changed source keys.

:::

## Data Scope

A **data scope** represents data for a certain unit, e.g. the top level scope (involving all data for a flow), for a document, or for a chunk.
A data scope has a bunch of fields and collectors, and users can add new fields and collectors to it.

### Get or Add a Field

You can get or add a field of a data scope (which is a data slice). 

:::note

You cannot override an existing field.

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

Getting and setting a field of a data scope is done by the `[]` operator with a field name:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):

    # Add "documents" to the top-level data scope.
    data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(DemoSourceSpec(...))

    # Each row of "documents" is a child scope.
    with data_scope["documents"].row() as document:

        # Get "content" from the document scope, transform, and add "summary" to scope.
        document["summary"] = field1_row["content"].transform(DemoFunctionSpec(...))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add a collector

See [Data Collector](#data-collector) below for more details.

## Data Slice

A **data slice** references a subset of data belonging to a data scope, e.g. a specific field from a data scope.
A data slice has a certain data type, and it's the input for most operations.

### Transform

`transform()` method transforms the data slice by a function, which creates another data slice.
A *function spec* needs to be provided for any transform operation, to describe the function and parameters related to the function.

The function takes one or multiple data arguments.
The first argument is the data slice to be transformed, and the `transform()` method is applied from it.
Other arguments can be passed in as positional arguments or keyword arguments, aftert the function spec.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    ...
    data_scope["field2"] = data_scope["field1"].transform(
                               DemoFunctionSpec(...),
                               arg1, arg2, ..., key0=kwarg0, key1=kwarg1, ...)
    ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### For each row

If the data slice has `Table` type, you can call `row()` method to obtain a child scope representing each row, to apply operations on each row.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
  ...
  with data_scope["table1"].row() as table1_row:
    # Children operations
    table1_row["field2"] = table1_row["field1"].transform(DemoFunctionSpec(...))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Get a sub field

If the data slice has `Struct` type, you can obtain a data slice on a specific sub field of it, similar to getting a field of a data scope.

## Data Collector

A **data collector** can be added from a specific data scope, and it collects multiple entries of data from the same or children scope.

### Collect

Call its `collect()` method to collect a specific entry, which can have multiple fields.
Each field has a name as specified by the argument name, and a value in one of the following representations:

*   A `DataSlice`.
*   An enum `cocoindex.GeneratedField.UUID` indicating its value is an UUID automatically generated by the engine.
    The uuid will remain stable when other collected input values are unchanged.

    :::note

    An automatically generated UUID field is allowed to appear at most once.

    :::

For example,

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    ...
    demo_collector = data_scope.add_collector()
    with data_scope["documents"].row() as document:
        ...
        demo_collector.collect(id=cocoindex.GeneratedField.UUID,
                               filename=document["filename"],
                               summary=document["summary"])
    ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here the collector is in the top-level data scope.
It collects `filename` and `summary` fields from each row of `documents`,
and generates a `id` field with UUID and remains stable when `filename` and `summary` are unchanged.

### Export

The `export()` method exports the collected data to an external storage.

A *storage spec* needs to be provided for any export operation, to describe the storage and parameters related to the storage.

Export must happen at the top level of a flow, i.e. not within any child scopes created by "for each row". It takes the following arguments:

*   `name`: the name to identify the export target.
*   `target_spec`: the storage spec as the export target.
*   `primary_key_fields` (`Sequence[str]`): the fields to be used as primary key. Types of the fields must be supported as key fields. See [Key Types](data_types#key-types) for more details.
*   `vector_indexes` (`Sequence[VectorIndexDef]`, optional): the fields to create vector index. `VectorIndexDef` has the following fields:
    *   `field_name`: the field to create vector index.
    *   `metric`: the similarity metric to use. See [Vector Type](data_types#vector-type) for more details about supported similarity metrics.
*   `setup_by_user` (optional):
     whether the export target is setup by user.
     By default, CocoIndex is managing the target setup (surfaced by the `cocoindex setup` CLI subcommand), e.g. create related tables/collections/etc. with compatible schema, and update them upon change.
     If `True`, the export target will be managed by users, and users are responsible for creating the target and updating it upon change.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="DemoFlow")
def demo_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    ...
    demo_collector = data_scope.add_collector()
    ...
    demo_collector.export(
        "demo_storage", DemoStorageSpec(...),
        primary_key_fields=["field1"],
        vector_index=[("field2", cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The target storage is managed by CocoIndex, i.e. it'll be created by [CocoIndex CLI](/docs/core/cli) when you run `cocoindex setup`, and the data will be automatically updated (including stale data removal) when updating the index.
The `name` for the same storage should remain stable across different runs.
If it changes, CocoIndex will treat it as an old storage removed and a new one created, and perform setup changes and reindexing accordingly.
