# iRacing MCP

iRacing MCP is a Python-based project that integrates iRacing with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides tools and resources to interact with iRacing data and build custom applications.

## Features

- Retrieve iRacing profile statistics.
- More coming soon

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- uv - [Install here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- iRacing account with legacy authentication (required) - Enable it here: https://oauth.iracing.com/accountmanagement/security

## Usage

### Running the Server Standalone

To start the MCP server, run:

```bash
IRACING_USERNAME="your username" IRACING_PASSWORD="your-password" uvx iracing-mcp
```

### Running the Server on VSCode

Add this to your settings.json (in `mcp.servers`):

```json
"iracing": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "iracing-mcp@latest"
    ],
    "env": {
        "IRACING_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "IRACING_PASSWORD": "your password"
    }
}
```

### Running the Server on other MCP Clients

Currently I am only using VS Code as MCP Client so I don't know how to configure to other MCP Clients.
I am happy to receive PRs on how to configure in the different MCP Servers (e.g. Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/musantro/iracing-mcp.git
   cd iracing-mcp
   ```

2. Create environment with dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for iRacing credentials:
   ```bash
   export IRACING_USERNAME="your_username"
   export IRACING_PASSWORD="your_password"
   ```

#### Linting and Formatting

Use the following commands to lint and format the code:

```bash
make
```
