              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

# PySubnet 
### Quick & easy mutli-node substrate network setup

## 🔧 Description

**PySubnet** automates the process generating, inserting and updating chainspecs for multi-node setups. Like:

- Generating **Aura** and **Grandpa** keys (or any other keys that you wish to use as session keys).
- Inserting them into the **keystore** for each node's `--base-path`
- Generating **libp2p** node keys to use for running the node using `--node-key-file`.
- Updating the **chainspec** with all relevant key and network information.
- Extending chainspec edit process using custom chainspec_handlers defined in [chainspec_handlers.py](./chainspec_handlers.py) file

Currently, it supports **Aura + Grandpa** based Substrate chains. You can adapt the logic to support different key types as needed.

It also supports key generations for AccountIds using built-in subkey in the substrate binary provided or using ECDSA keys generated using the [ethereum](./ethereum.py) module.

---

## 📦 Installation

### 🔌 Using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pysubnet
```
Or get the latest version from github:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/weezy20/pysubnet.git
```
Or run it without installing anything using `pipx` or `uvx`:
### ⚡ Using `uv` by [astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):
```sh
uvx git+https://github.com/weezy20/pysubnet.git
```

Or create a virutalenv with `python >=3.10` and install it inside it using pip, uv, etc.

```sh
# Create virtualenv with python >=3.10
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
# or if using uv
uv venv test
source test/.venv/bin/activate
# Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
Then install it
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/weezy20/pysubnet.git
# or if using uv
uv pip install git+https://github.com/weezy20/pysubnet.git
```

> **Note:** If you're on a system without Python development headers (like `Python.h`), and see missing header errors during install you would need to install them:
>
> - On **Debian/Ubuntu**, run: `sudo apt install python3-dev`
> - On **RedHat/Fedora**, run: `sudo dnf install python3-devel`
> - On **Mac**, make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed: `xcode-select --install`

---

## 🚀 Usage

### ✅ Pre-requisites
- **Substrate Binary** (required):  
    A compiled Substrate binary. By default, pysubnet looks for a binary named `substrate`. If your binary has a different name or is located elsewhere, you can specify its path using the `--bin` flag.

- **Chainspec File** (optional):  
    A `chainspec.json` file can be provided as a base template for your network configuration.

---

### 📦 Basic Command

```sh
pysubnet
```
or 
```sh
pysubnet -i # Recommended
```

This uses the default settings:
- Chainspec: `"dev"`
- Root directory: `./network`
- Substrate binary: `./substrate`

You can use all flags with `-i`. The main reason for having flags is to use in non-interactive setups where developers need quick network startup
A developer might create a substrate node with their custom chainspec edits in the `custom_network_config()` function in [chainspec_handlers.py](./src/pysubnet/chainspec_handlers.py) file and then may run 

```sh
pysubnet -c # (clean existing root-dir if present) 
         -r # (invoke start_network())
         --bin <custom bin> # (provide a custom bin)
``` 
---

### 🧹 Clean Start

By default, PySubnet **won’t overwrite an existing root directory** if it has contents. To clear it before launching:

```sh
pysubnet --clean 
or 
pysubnet -c 
```

---

### 📁 Custom Root Directory

```sh
pysubnet --root ./my_custom_dir
```

All generated keys, node information, and chain specs will be stored under this directory, and a `pysubnet.json` file will be generated that holds all keys, ports, flags required to run your network:
```
<ROOT_DIR>/pysubnet.json
```

---

### 📜 Custom Chainspec

Pass in your own chainspec file:

```sh
pysubnet --chainspec ./my_chainspec.json
```

Or use the default embedded options:
```sh
pysubnet --chainspec dev # default option equivalent to running without --chainspec flag

```
or
```sh
pysubnet --chainspec local
```
`PySubnet` will inject generated bootnodes into the chainspec, and based on one of `custom_network_config()` [Default] or `enable_poa()`[`--poa`] will inject authorities to the genesis. It will then generate a raw_chainspec file and use that to spawn of  the network in `start_network()`

---

`-r` or `--run` will invoke `start_network()` to start the network. This will:

- Spawn each node in a separate process.
- Use the generated keystores and updated chainspec.
- Write logs to `<node-name>.log` located inside each node's directory.

Generate keys, insert keys, update chainspec, generate raw chainspec and launch the network in one step:
```sh
pysubnet -icr # interactive
or 
pysubnet -cr # non-interactive
```
It's helpful to use `-c` as often you'll be using the same `<ROOT_DIR>`

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ Enable Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Mode

For Substrate-node-template based chains (Simple Aura+Grandpa session keys), you can enable Proof-of-Authority (PoA) mode, which assigns all authorities equal weight in the chainspec and inserts their Aura-SS58 & Grandpa-SS58 keys. This is useful for testing and development purposes when starting out learning substrate. Also works for `frontier/template` or any node that has a "aura" and "grandpa" in their runtime-genesis["patch"] section.
]
as it's same in consensus to the default `substrate-node-template`

```sh
pysubnet --poa -r 
# Automates the tutorial "Start a private network with 3 nodes" that used to be in the now gone substrate.io website
```

---

## 🧾 Full Argument Reference

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-i`, `--interactive` | Run in interactive mode | `pysubnet -i` |
| `--run`, `--start`, `-r` | Launch network after key/chainspec generation | `pysubnet --run` |
| `--root` | Set custom root directory for network artifacts | `pysubnet --root ./my-net` |
| `-c`, `--clean` | Clean the root directory before starting | `pysubnet -c` |
| `--chainspec` | Provide a chainspec file to use as a starter template or use `dev` / `local` | `--chainspec dev` or `--chainspec ./custom.json` |
| `--bin` | Path to Substrate binary | `--bin ./target/release/node-template` |
| `--account` | AccountId type to use for ValidatorId, "ecdsa" or "sr25519" | `--account ecdsa` or `--account sr25519"` |
| `--poa` | Enable POA. Absence of this flag branches code into `custom_network_config` which is user defined | `pysubnet --poa --run` |

---

## 🧠 Notes

- All node data (crypto keys, Account keys, libp2p keys, node IDs) is stored in `pysubnet.json`.
- The script auto-generates keystores compatible with Substrate’s expected format.
- You can choose between `AccountId20` or `AccountId32` for your AccountId (validator account keys)
- Make sure your node uses the same account type as the `--account` you pass to pysubnet. Not doing so will result in a runtime error
- Chainspecs are automatically modified in-place with new authority and bootnodes + libp2p identity. All editors are defined in [chainspec_handlers.py](./src/pysubnet/chainspec_handlers.py) and inserted before `start_network()` call.
- Do not pass `-r` if you just want to prepare base-paths for a multi-node network.
- Sometimes CTRL-C might give you an error. This is because we use a sleep timer for 2 seconds in `main.py` to reduce CPU interuppts. This is easily fixed by tapping CTRL-C in succession.
