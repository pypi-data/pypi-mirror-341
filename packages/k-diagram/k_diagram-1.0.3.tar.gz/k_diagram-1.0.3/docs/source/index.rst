    Welcome to the official documentation for `k-diagram`. This package
    provides a unique perspective on evaluating forecasting models,
    especially when uncertainty quantification is crucial. Dive in to
    discover how polar plots can reveal deeper insights into your
    model's performance, stability, and potential weaknesses.

    * **Intuitive Polar Perspective:** Visualize multi-dimensional
        aspects like uncertainty spread, temporal drift, and spatial
        patterns in a compact circular layout.
    * **Targeted Diagnostics:** Functions specifically designed to
        assess interval coverage, consistency, anomaly magnitude, model
        velocity, and drift.
    * **Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation:** Move beyond point-forecast
        accuracy and evaluate the reliability of your model's
        uncertainty estimates.
    * **Identify Model Weaknesses:** Pinpoint where and when your
        forecasts are less reliable or exhibit significant anomalies.
    * **Clear Communication:** Generate publication-ready plots to
        effectively communicate model performance and uncertainty
        characteristics.
