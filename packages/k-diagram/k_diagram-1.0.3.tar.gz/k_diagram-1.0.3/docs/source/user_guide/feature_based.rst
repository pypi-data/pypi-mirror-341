Feature Importance Visualization
==================================

Understanding which input features most significantly influence a model's
predictions is crucial for interpretation, debugging, and building
trust in forecasting models. While overall importance scores are useful,
visualizing how these importances compare across different contexts
(e.g., different models, time periods, spatial regions) can reveal
deeper insights.

`k-diagram` provides a specialized radar chart, the "Feature
Fingerprint," to effectively visualize and compare these multi-
dimensional feature importance profiles.

Detailed Explanations
-----------------------

Let's explore the Feature Fingerprint plot.

.. _ug_feature_fingerprint:

Feature Importance Fingerprint (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_fingerprint`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function generates a polar radar chart designed to visually
compare the importance or contribution profiles of multiple features
across different groups, conditions, or models (referred to as "layers").
Each layer is represented by a distinct colored polygon on the chart,
creating a unique "fingerprint" of feature influence for that layer. It
allows for easy identification of dominant features, relative importance
patterns, and shifts in influence across the layers being compared.

**Mathematical Concept:**
Let :math:`\mathbf{R}` be the input `importances` matrix of shape
:math:`(M, N)`, where :math:`M` is the number of layers and :math:`N`
is the number of features.

1.  **Angle Assignment:** Each feature :math:`j` is assigned an axis on
    the radar chart at an evenly spaced angle:
    
    .. math::
        \theta_j = \frac{2 \pi j}{N}, \quad j = 0, 1, \dots, N-1

2.  **Radial Value (Importance):** For each layer :math:`i` and feature
    :math:`j`, the radial distance :math:`r_{ij}` represents the
    importance value from the input matrix :math:`\mathbf{R}`.

3.  **Normalization (Optional):** If ``normalize=True``, the importances
    within each layer (row) :math:`i` are scaled independently to the
    range [0, 1]:
    
    .. math::
        r'_{ij} = \frac{r_{ij}}{\max_{k}(r_{ik})}
        
    If the maximum importance in a layer is zero or less, the normalized
    values for that layer are set to zero. The radius plotted is then
    :math:`r'_{ij}`. If ``normalize=False``, the raw radius :math:`r_{ij}`
    is used.

4.  **Plotting:** Points :math:`(r, \theta)` are plotted for each feature
    and connected to form a polygon for each layer. The shape is closed
    by connecting the last feature's point back to the first. The area
    can optionally be filled (``fill=True``).

**Interpretation:**

* **Axes:** Each angular axis corresponds to a specific input feature.
* **Polygons (Layers):** Each colored polygon represents a different
    layer (e.g., Model A vs. Model B, or Zone 1 vs. Zone 2).
* **Radius:** The distance from the center along a feature's axis
    indicates the importance of that feature for a given layer.
* **Shape (Normalized View):** When ``normalize=True``, compare the
    *shapes* of the polygons. This highlights the *relative* importance
    patterns. Which features are *most* important within each layer,
    regardless of overall magnitude? Do different layers rely on vastly
    different feature subsets?
* **Size (Raw View):** When ``normalize=False``, compare the overall
    *size* of the polygons. A larger polygon indicates that the layer
    generally assigns higher absolute importance scores across features
    compared to a smaller polygon (though interpretation depends on the
    nature of the importance metric).
* **Dominant Features:** Features corresponding to axes where polygons
    extend furthest are the most influential for those respective layers.

**Use Cases:**

* **Comparing Model Interpretations:** Visualize and contrast feature
    importance derived from different model types (e.g., Random Forest vs.
    Gradient Boosting) trained on the same data.
* **Analyzing Importance Drift:** Plot importance profiles calculated
    for different time periods or spatial regions to see if feature
    influence changes.
* **Identifying Characteristic Fingerprints:** Understand the typical
    pattern of feature reliance for a specific system or model setup.
* **Debugging and Validation:** Check if the feature importance profile
    aligns with domain knowledge or expectations.

**Advantages (Polar/Radar Context):**

* Excellent for simultaneously comparing multiple multi-dimensional
    profiles (feature importance vectors) against a common set of axes
    (features).
* The closed polygon shape provides a distinct visual "fingerprint" for
    each layer.
* Makes it easy to spot the most dominant features (those axes with the
    largest radial values) for each layer.
* Normalization allows comparing relative patterns effectively, even if
    absolute importance scales differ significantly between layers.
