Visualizing Forecast Uncertainty
=======================================

Effective forecasting involves more than just predicting a single future
value; it requires understanding the inherent **uncertainty** surrounding
that prediction. Point forecasts alone can be misleading, especially
when making critical decisions based on them. `k-diagram` provides a
suite of specialized polar visualizations designed to dissect and
illuminate various facets of forecast uncertainty.

Why Polar Plots for Uncertainty?
------------------------------------

Traditional Cartesian plots can become cluttered when visualizing
multiple aspects of uncertainty across many data points or locations.
`k-diagram` leverages the polar coordinate system to:

* Provide a **compact overview** of uncertainty characteristics
    across the entire dataset (represented angularly).
* Highlight **patterns** in uncertainty related to temporal or
    spatial dimensions (if mapped to the angle).
* Visually emphasize **drift**, **anomalies**, and **coverage**
    in intuitive ways using radial distance and color.

This page details the functions within `k-diagram` focused on
evaluating prediction intervals, diagnosing coverage failures,
analyzing anomaly severity, and tracking how uncertainty evolves.

Detailed Explanations
---------------------

Let's explore some of these functions in detail.

.. _ug_actual_vs_predicted:

Actual vs. Predicted Comparison (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_actual_vs_predicted`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This plot provides a direct visual comparison between the actual
observed ground truth values and the model's point predictions
(typically the median forecast, Q50) for each sample or location.
It's a fundamental diagnostic for assessing basic model accuracy and
identifying systematic biases.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each data point :math:`i`, we have an actual value :math:`y_i` and a
predicted value :math:`\hat{y}_i`. The plot displays both values radially
at a corresponding angle :math:`\theta_i`. The difference, or error,
:math:`e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i`, is implicitly visualized by the gap
between the plotted points/lines for actual and predicted values. Often,
gray lines connect :math:`y_i` and :math:`\hat{y}_i` at each angle to
emphasize the error magnitude and direction.

**Interpretation:**

* **Closeness:** How close are the points or lines representing actual
    and predicted values? Closer alignment indicates better point-forecast
    accuracy.
* **Systematic Bias:** Does the prediction line/dots consistently sit
    inside or outside the actual line/dots? This indicates a systematic
    under- or over-prediction bias.
* **Error Magnitude:** The length of the connecting gray lines (if shown)
    or the radial distance between points directly shows the prediction
    error for each sample. Large gaps indicate poor predictions for those
    points.
* **Angular Patterns:** If the angle :math:`\theta` represents a meaningful
    dimension (like time index, season, or spatial grouping), look for
    patterns in accuracy or bias around the circle. Does the model perform
    better or worse at certain "angles"?

**Use Cases:**

* **Initial Performance Check:** Get a quick overview of how well the
    point forecast aligns with reality across the dataset.
* **Bias Detection:** Easily spot systematic over- or under-prediction.
* **Identifying Problematic Regions:** If using angles meaningfully,
    locate specific periods or areas where point predictions are poor.
* **Communicating Basic Accuracy:** Provides a simple visual for
    stakeholders before diving into complex uncertainty measures.

**Advantages of Polar View:**

* Provides a compact, circular overview of performance across many samples.
* Can make cyclical patterns (if angle relates to time, like month or
    hour) more apparent than a standard time series plot.

.. _ug_anomaly_magnitude:

Anomaly Magnitude Analysis (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_anomaly_magnitude`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This diagnostic specifically focuses on **prediction interval failures**.
It identifies instances where the actual observed value falls *outside*
the predicted range [Qlow, Qup] and visualizes the **location**, **type**
(under- or over-prediction), and **severity** (magnitude) of these
anomalies. It answers: "When my model's uncertainty bounds are wrong,
*how wrong* are they, and where?"

**Mathematical Concept:**
An anomaly exists if the actual value :math:`y_i` is outside the
interval defined by the lower (:math:`Q_{low,i}`) and upper
(:math:`Q_{up,i}`) quantiles.

* **Under-prediction:** :math:`y_i < Q_{low,i}`
* **Over-prediction:** :math:`y_i > Q_{up,i}`

The **magnitude** (:math:`r_i`) of the anomaly is the absolute distance
from the actual value to the *nearest violated bound*:

.. math::

   r_i =
   \begin{cases}
     Q_{low,i} - y_i & \text{if } y_i < Q_{low,i} \\
     y_i - Q_{up,i} & \text{if } y_i > Q_{up,i} \\
     0              & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}

Only points where :math:`r_i > 0` are plotted. The radial coordinate of
a plotted point is :math:`r_i`.

**Interpretation:**

* **Presence/Absence:** Points only appear if an anomaly occurred. A sparse
    plot indicates good interval coverage. Dense clusters indicate regions
    of poor uncertainty estimation.
* **Radius:** The distance from the center directly represents the
    **severity** of the anomaly. Points far from the center are large
    errors relative to the predicted bounds.
* **Color:** Distinct colors (e.g., blues for under-prediction, reds for
    over-prediction) immediately classify the type of failure. Color
    intensity often also maps to the magnitude :math:`r_i`.
* **Angular Position:** Shows *where* (which samples, locations, or times,
    based on the angle representation) these failures occur. Look for
    clustering at specific angles.

**Use Cases:**

* **Risk Assessment:** Identify predictions where the actual outcome might
    be significantly worse than the uncertainty bounds suggested.
* **Model Calibration Check:** Assess if the prediction intervals are
    meaningful. Frequent or large anomalies suggest poor calibration.
* **Pinpointing Failure Modes:** Determine if the model tends to fail more
    by under-predicting or over-predicting, and under what conditions
    (angles).
* **Targeting Investigation:** Guide further analysis or data collection
    efforts towards the specific samples/locations exhibiting the most
    severe anomalies.

**Advantages of Polar View:**

* Provides a focused view solely on prediction interval failures.
* Radial distance intuitively maps to error magnitude/severity.
* Color effectively separates under- vs. over-prediction types.
* Circular layout helps identify patterns or concentrations of anomalies
    across the angular dimension.

.. _ug_coverage:

Overall Coverage Scores (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function calculates and visualizes the **overall empirical
coverage rate** for one or more sets of predictions. It answers the
fundamental question: "Across the entire dataset, what fraction of the
time did the true observed values fall within the specified prediction
interval bounds (e.g., Q10 to Q90)?" It allows for comparing this
aggregate performance across different models or prediction sets using
various chart types.

**Mathematical Concept:**
The empirical coverage for a given prediction interval
:math:`[Q_{low,i}, Q_{up,i}]` and actual values :math:`y_i` over
:math:`N` samples is calculated as:

.. math::

   \text{Coverage} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}\{Q_{low,i} \le y_i \le Q_{up,i}\}

Where :math:`\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}` is the indicator function, which is 1
if the condition (actual value :math:`y_i` is within the bounds) is
true, and 0 otherwise.

For point predictions :math:`\hat{y}_i`, coverage typically measures
exact matches (often resulting in very low scores unless data is
discrete): :math:`\text{Coverage} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}`.

**Interpretation:**

* **Compare to Nominal Rate:** The primary use is to compare the
    calculated empirical coverage rate against the **nominal coverage rate**
    implied by the quantiles used. For example, a Q10-Q90 interval has a
    nominal coverage of 80% (0.8).
    * If Empirical Coverage ≈ Nominal Coverage: The intervals are well-
        calibrated on average.
    * If Empirical Coverage > Nominal Coverage: The intervals are too wide
        (conservative) on average.
    * If Empirical Coverage < Nominal Coverage: The intervals are too narrow
        (overconfident) on average.
* **Model Comparison:** When plotting multiple models, directly compare
    their coverage scores. A model closer to the nominal rate is generally
    better calibrated in terms of its average interval performance.
* **Chart Type:**
    * `bar` or `line`: Good for direct comparison of scores between models.
    * `pie`: Shows the proportion of coverage relative to the sum (less common
        for direct calibration assessment).
    * `radar`: Provides a profile view comparing multiple models across the
        same metric (coverage).

**Use Cases:**

* Quickly assessing the average calibration of prediction intervals for
    one or multiple models.
* Comparing the overall reliability of uncertainty estimates from different
    forecasting methods.
* Summarizing interval performance for reporting.

**Advantages:**

* Provides a single, easily interpretable summary statistic for average
    interval performance per model.
* Offers multiple visualization options (`kind` parameter) for flexible
    comparison.

**Example:**
(See :ref:`Gallery <gallery_plot_overall_coverage>` for code and plot examples)

.. _ug_coverage_diagnostic:

Point-wise Coverage Diagnostic (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage_diagnostic`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
While :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage` gives an overall
average, this function provides a **granular, point-by-point diagnostic**
of prediction interval coverage on a polar plot. It visualizes *where*
(at which specific sample, location, or time, represented angularly)
the prediction intervals succeeded or failed to capture the actual value.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each data point :math:`i`, a binary coverage indicator :math:`c_i` is
calculated:

.. math::

   c_i = \mathbf{1}\{Q_{low,i} \le y_i \le Q_{up,i}\}

Each point :math:`i` is then plotted at an angle :math:`\theta_i`
(determined by its index or an optional feature) and a **radius**
:math:`r_i = c_i`. This means:

* Covered points (:math:`c_i=1`) are plotted at radius **1**.
* Uncovered points (:math:`c_i=0`) are plotted at radius **0**.

The plot also typically shows the overall coverage rate
:math:`\bar{c} = \frac{1}{N} \sum c_i` as a prominent reference circle.

**Interpretation:**

* **Radial Position:** Instantly separates successes (radius 1) from
    failures (radius 0).
* **Angular Clusters:** Look for clusters of points at radius 0. Such
    clusters indicate specific regions, times, or conditions (depending on
    what the angle represents) where the model's prediction intervals
    systematically fail. Randomly scattered points at radius 0 suggest less
    systematic issues.
* **Average Coverage Line:** The solid circular line drawn at radius
    :math:`\bar{c}` represents the overall empirical coverage rate. Compare
    its position to:
    * The nominal coverage rate (e.g., 0.8 for an 80% interval).
    * Reference grid lines (often shown at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0).
* **Background Gradient (Optional):** If enabled, the shaded gradient
    extending from the center to the average coverage line provides a strong
    visual cue for the overall performance level.
* **Point/Bar Color:** Color (e.g., green for covered, red for uncovered
    using the default 'RdYlGn' cmap) reinforces the binary status.

**Use Cases:**

* **Diagnosing Coverage Failures:** Go beyond the average rate to see
    *where* and *how often* intervals fail.
* **Identifying Systematic Issues:** Detect if failures are concentrated
    in specific segments of the data (angles).
* **Visual Calibration Assessment:** Provides a more intuitive feel for
    calibration than just a single number. Is the coverage rate met because
    most points are covered, or are there many failures balanced by overly
    wide intervals elsewhere?
* **Debugging Model Uncertainty:** Pinpoint areas needing improved
    uncertainty quantification.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Excellent for visualizing the status of many points compactly.
* The radial mapping (0 or 1) provides a very clear visual separation
    of coverage success/failure.
* Angular clustering of failures is easily identifiable.
* The average coverage line acts as an immediate visual benchmark against
    the plot boundaries (0 and 1) and reference grid lines.

**Example:**
(See :ref:`Gallery <gallery_plot_coverage_diagnostic>` or function docstring for code and plot examples)

.. _ug_interval_consistency:

Interval Width Consistency (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_consistency`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This plot analyzes the **temporal stability** of the predicted
uncertainty range. It visualizes how much the **width** of the
prediction interval (:math:`Q_{up} - Q_{low}`) fluctuates for each
location or sample across multiple time steps or forecast horizons.
It answers: "Are the model's uncertainty estimates stable over time for
a given location, or do they vary wildly?"

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each location/sample :math:`j`, the interval width is calculated
for each available time step :math:`t`:

.. math::

   w_{j,t} = Q_{up,j,t} - Q_{low,j,t}

The plot then visualizes the *variability* of these widths :math:`w_{j,t}`
over the time steps :math:`t` for each location :math:`j`. The radial
coordinate :math:`r_j` typically represents either:

1.  **Standard Deviation:** :math:`r_j = \sigma_t(w_{j,t})` - Measures the
    absolute variability of the width.
2.  **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** :math:`r_j = \frac{\sigma_t(w_{j,t})}{\mu_t(w_{j,t})}`
    - Measures the relative variability (standard deviation relative to the
    mean width). Set via the ``use_cv=True`` parameter.

Each location :math:`j` is plotted at an angle :math:`\theta_j` (based
on index) and radius :math:`r_j`. The color of the point often represents
the *average median prediction* :math:`\mu_t(Q_{50,j,t})` across the time
steps, providing context.

**Interpretation:**

* **Radius:** Points far from the center indicate locations where the
    prediction interval width is **inconsistent** or varies significantly
    across the different time steps/horizons considered. Points near the
    center have stable interval width predictions over time.
* **CV vs. Standard Deviation (`use_cv`):**
    * If `use_cv=False` (default), radius shows *absolute* standard
        deviation. A large radius means large absolute fluctuations in width.
    * If `use_cv=True`, radius shows *relative* variability (CV). A large
        radius means the width fluctuates significantly *compared to its
        average width*. This helps compare consistency across locations that
        might have very different average interval widths.
* **Color (Context):** If `q50_cols` are provided, color typically shows
    the average Q50 value. This helps answer questions like: "Does high
    inconsistency (large radius) tend to occur in locations with high or low
    average predicted values?"
* **Angular Clusters:** Clusters of points with high/low radius might indicate
    spatial patterns in the stability of uncertainty predictions.

**Use Cases:**

* **Assessing Model Reliability Over Time:** Identify locations where
    uncertainty estimates are unstable across forecast horizons.
* **Diagnosing Temporal Effects:** Understand if interval predictions
    become more or less variable further into the future.
* **Comparing Relative vs. Absolute Stability:** Use `use_cv` to
    distinguish between large absolute fluctuations and large relative
    fluctuations.
* **Identifying Locations for Scrutiny:** Points with high inconsistency
    might warrant further investigation into why the uncertainty estimate
    is so variable for those locations/conditions.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Compactly displays the consistency profile across many locations.
* Radial distance provides an intuitive measure of inconsistency
    (variability).
* Allows visual identification of clusters based on consistency levels.
* Color adds valuable context about the average prediction level associated
    with different consistency levels.

.. _ug_interval_width:

Prediction Interval Width Visualization (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_width`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a polar scatter plot focused solely on the
**magnitude of predicted uncertainty**. It visualizes the **width** of
the prediction interval (:math:`Q_{up} - Q_{low}`) for each individual
sample or location, typically at a single snapshot in time or for a
specific forecast horizon. It answers: "How wide is the predicted
uncertainty range for each point in my dataset?"

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each data point :math:`i`, the interval width is calculated:

.. math::

   w_i = Q_{up,i} - Q_{low,i}

The point is plotted at an angle :math:`\theta_i` (based on index) and a
**radius** :math:`r_i = w_i`. Optionally, a third variable :math:`z_i`
from a specified ``z_col`` can determine the color of the point; otherwise,
the color typically represents the width :math:`w_i` itself.

**Interpretation:**

* **Radius:** The radial distance directly corresponds to the width of
    the prediction interval. Points far from the center represent samples
    with high predicted uncertainty (wide intervals). Points near the
    center have low predicted uncertainty (narrow intervals).
* **Color (with `z_col`):** If a ``z_col`` (e.g., the median prediction
    Q50, or the actual value) is provided, the color allows you to see how
    interval width relates to that variable. For example, are wider
    intervals (larger radius) associated with higher or lower median
    predictions (color)?
* **Color (without `z_col`):** If no ``z_col`` is given, color usually
    maps to the width itself, reinforcing the radial information.
* **Angular Patterns:** Look for regions around the circle (representing
    subsets of data based on index order or a future `theta_col`
    implementation) that exhibit consistently high or low interval widths.

**Use Cases:**

* Identifying samples or locations with the largest/smallest predicted
    uncertainty ranges at a specific time/horizon.
* Visualizing the overall distribution of uncertainty magnitudes across
    the dataset.
* Exploring potential relationships between uncertainty width and other
    factors (e.g., input features, predicted value magnitude) by using
    the ``z_col`` option.
* Assessing if uncertainty is relatively uniform or highly variable
    across samples.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Provides a compact overview of uncertainty magnitude for many points.
* The radial distance offers a direct, intuitive mapping for interval
    width.
* Facilitates the visual identification of angular patterns or clusters
    related to uncertainty levels.
* Allows simultaneous visualization of location (angle), uncertainty
    width (radius), and a third variable (color via ``z_col``).

**Example:**
(See :ref:`Gallery <gallery_plot_interval_width>` or function docstring for code and plot examples)

.. _ug_model_drift:

Model Forecast Drift (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This visualization focuses on **model degradation over forecast
horizons**. It creates a polar *bar* chart to show how the *average*
prediction uncertainty (specifically, the mean interval width
:math:`\mathbb{E}[Q_{up} - Q_{low}]`) changes as the forecast lead time
increases. It helps diagnose *concept drift* or *model aging* effects
related to uncertainty.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each distinct forecast horizon :math:`h` (e.g., 1-step ahead, 2-steps
ahead), the average interval width across all :math:`N` samples is
calculated:

.. math::

   \bar{w}_h = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} (Q_{up,j,h} - Q_{low,j,h})

Each horizon :math:`h` is assigned a distinct angle :math:`\theta_h` on
the polar plot. A bar is drawn at this angle with a height (radius)
proportional to the average width :math:`\bar{w}_h`. The color of the
bar typically also reflects this average width, or potentially another
aggregated metric for that horizon if ``color_metric_cols`` is used.

**Interpretation:**

* **Radial Growth:** The key aspect is the change in bar height (radius)
    as the angle (horizon) progresses. A noticeable increase in radius for
    later horizons indicates that, on average, the model's prediction
    intervals widen significantly as it forecasts further into the future.
    This signifies increasing uncertainty or *model drift*.
* **Bar Height Comparison:** Directly compare the heights of bars for
    different horizons to quantify the average increase in uncertainty.
    Annotations usually display the exact average width :math:`\bar{w}_h`
    for each horizon.
* **Stability:** Bars of relatively similar height across horizons suggest
    that the model's average uncertainty level is stable over the forecast
    lead times considered.

**Use Cases:**

* **Detecting Model Degradation:** Identify if forecast uncertainty grows
    unacceptably large at longer lead times.
* **Assessing Forecast Reliability Horizon:** Determine the practical
    limit of how far ahead the model provides reasonably certain forecasts.
* **Informing Retraining Strategy:** Significant drift might indicate the
    need for more frequent model retraining or incorporating features that
    capture evolving dynamics.
* **Comparing Model Stability:** Generate plots for different models to
    compare how their uncertainty characteristics drift over time.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* The polar bar chart format makes the "outward drift" of average
    uncertainty across increasing horizons (angles) very intuitive to grasp.
* Provides a concise summary comparing average uncertainty levels across
    multiple forecast lead times.

**Example:**

.. _ug_temporal_uncertainty:

General Polar Series Visualization (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_temporal_uncertainty`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This is a **general-purpose** polar scatter plot utility within the
uncertainty module, designed for visualizing and comparing **multiple
data series** (columns from a DataFrame) simultaneously. While flexible,
a common application in uncertainty analysis is to plot different quantile
predictions (e.g., Q10, Q50, Q90) for the *same* forecast horizon to
visualize the **uncertainty spread** at that specific point in time across
all samples.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each data series :math:`k` (corresponding to a column in ``q_cols``)
and each sample :math:`i`, the value :math:`v_{i,k}` is plotted at an
angle :math:`\theta_i` (based on index) and radius :math:`r_{i,k} = v_{i,k}`.

If ``normalize=True``, each series :math:`k` is independently scaled
to the range [0, 1] before plotting using min-max scaling:
:math:`r_{i,k} = (v_{i,k} - \min_j(v_{j,k})) / (\max_j(v_{j,k}) - \min_j(v_{j,k}))`.
Each series :math:`k` is assigned a distinct color.

**Interpretation:**

* **Series Comparison:** Observe the relative radial positions of points
    belonging to different series (colors) at the same angle.
* **Uncertainty Spread (Quantile Use Case):** When plotting Q10, Q50,
    and Q90 for a single horizon:
    * The **radial distance** between the points for Q10 (e.g., blue) and
        Q90 (e.g., red) at a specific angle represents the **interval width**
        (uncertainty) for that sample.
    * Look for how this spread varies around the circle (across samples).
    * The position of the Q50 points (e.g., green) shows the central tendency
        relative to the bounds.
* **Normalization Effect:** If ``normalize=True``, the plot emphasizes the
    *relative shapes* and *overlap* of the series, regardless of their
    original scales. This is useful for comparing patterns but loses
    information about absolute magnitudes. If ``normalize=False``, the
    radial axis reflects the actual data values.
* **Angular Patterns:** Observe if specific series tend to be higher or lower
    at certain angles (samples/locations).

**Use Cases:**

* **Visualizing Uncertainty Intervals:** Plot Qlow, Qmid, Qup for a *single*
    time step/horizon to see the uncertainty band across samples.
* **Comparing Multiple Models:** Plot the point predictions (e.g., Q50)
    from several different models to compare their outputs side-by-side.
* **Plotting Related Variables:** Visualize any set of related numerical
    columns from your DataFrame in a polar layout.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Allows overlaying multiple related data series in a single, compact plot.
* Effective for visualizing the *spread* or *range* between different
    series (like quantiles) at each angular position.
* Normalization option facilitates shape comparison for series with
    different scales.
* Can reveal shared cyclical patterns among the plotted series.

Multi-Time Uncertainty Drift Rings (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_uncertainty_drift`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This plot offers a dynamic view of how the **spatial pattern of
prediction uncertainty** (interval width) evolves across **multiple time
steps** (e.g., years) for all locations simultaneously. Unlike
:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift`, which averages
across locations for each horizon, this function plots each time step
as a distinct **concentric ring**, allowing direct comparison of the
uncertainty "map" at different times.

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each location :math:`j` and time step :math:`t`, the interval width
is calculated: :math:`w_{j,t} = Q_{up,j,t} - Q_{low,j,t}`. These widths
are typically **normalized globally** across all locations and times:
:math:`w'_{j,t} = w_{j,t} / \max_{j',t'}(w_{j',t'})`.

Each location :math:`j` corresponds to an angle :math:`\theta_j`. For a
given time step :math:`t`, the radius :math:`r_{j,t}` for location
:math:`j` is determined by a base offset for that ring plus the scaled
normalized width:

.. math::

   r_{j,t} = R_t + H \cdot w'_{j,t}

Where :math:`R_t` is the base radius for ring :math:`t` (increasing
with time, controlled by ``base_radius``) and :math:`H` is a scaling
factor (``band_height``) controlling the visual impact of the width.
Each ring :math:`t` receives a distinct color from the specified
``cmap``.

**Interpretation:**

* **Concentric Rings:** Each colored ring represents a specific time
    step, with inner rings typically corresponding to earlier times and
    outer rings to later times.
* **Ring Shape & Radius Variations:** The deviations of a single ring
    from a perfect circle show the spatial variability of uncertainty
    *at that specific time step*. Points on a ring that bulge outwards
    represent locations with higher relative uncertainty (wider intervals)
    at that time.
* **Comparing Rings:** Examine how the overall radius and "bumpiness"
    change from inner rings (earlier times) to outer rings (later times).
    If outer rings are consistently larger or more irregular, it suggests
    that uncertainty generally increases and/or becomes more spatially
    variable over time.
* **Angular Patterns:** Trace specific angles (locations) across multiple
    rings. Does the radius consistently increase (growing uncertainty at
    that location)? Is it consistently large or small (persistently
    high/low uncertainty location)?

**Use Cases:**

* Tracking the **full spatial pattern** of uncertainty as it evolves
    over multiple forecast periods.
* Identifying specific locations where uncertainty grows or shrinks most
    dramatically over time.
* Comparing the uncertainty landscape between different forecast horizons
    (e.g., visualizing the difference in uncertainty patterns between a
    1-year and a 5-year forecast).
* Complementing :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift` by
    showing detailed spatial variations instead of just the average trend.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Uniquely effective at overlaying multiple temporal snapshots of the
    uncertainty field in a single, comparative view.
* Concentric rings provide clear visual separation between time steps.
* Radial variations within each ring clearly highlight spatial differences
    in relative uncertainty at that time.
* Color coding aids in distinguishing and tracking specific time steps.

.. _ug_velocity:

Prediction Velocity Visualization (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_velocity`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This plot visualizes the **rate of change**, or **velocity**, of the
central forecast prediction (typically the median, Q50) over consecutive
time periods for each individual location or sample. It helps understand
the predicted dynamics of the phenomenon being forecast, answering: "How
fast is the predicted median value changing from one period to the next
at each location?"

**Mathematical Concept:**
For each location :math:`j`, the change in the median prediction between
consecutive time steps :math:`t` and :math:`t-1` is calculated:
:math:`\Delta Q_{50,j,t} = Q_{50,j,t} - Q_{50,j,t-1}`. The average velocity
for location :math:`j` over all time steps is the mean of these changes:

.. math::

   v_j = \mathbb{E}_t [ \Delta Q_{50,j,t} ]

The point for location :math:`j` is plotted at angle :math:`\theta_j`
(based on index) and radius :math:`r_j = v_j`. The radius can be
normalized to [0, 1] if ``normalize=True``. The color of the point can
represent either the velocity :math:`v_j` itself, or the average
absolute magnitude of the Q50 predictions
:math:`\mathbb{E}_t [ |Q_{50,j,t}| ]` (controlled by ``use_abs_color``).

**Interpretation:**

* **Radius:** Directly represents the average velocity (rate of change)
    of the Q50 prediction.
    * Points far from the center indicate locations with **high average
        velocity** (rapidly changing predictions).
    * Points near the center indicate locations with **low average
        velocity** (stable predictions).
    * If normalized, the radius shows relative velocity across locations.
* **Color (Mapped to Velocity):** If ``use_abs_color=False``, color
    directly reflects the velocity value :math:`v_j`. Using a diverging
    colormap (like 'coolwarm') helps distinguish between positive average
    change (e.g., red/warm colors for increasing values) and negative
    average change (e.g., blue/cool colors for decreasing values).
* **Color (Mapped to Q50 Magnitude):** If ``use_abs_color=True``, color
    shows the average absolute value of the Q50 predictions themselves.
    This provides context: Is high velocity (large radius) associated
    with high or low absolute predicted values (color)?
* **Angular Patterns:** Look for clusters of points with similar radius
    (velocity) or color at specific angles, which might indicate spatial
    patterns in the predicted dynamics.

**Use Cases:**

* Identifying spatial "hotspots" where the predicted phenomenon is changing
    most rapidly.
* Locating areas of predicted stability or stagnation.
* Analyzing and visualizing the spatial distribution of predicted trends or
    rates of change.
* Contextualizing velocity with the underlying magnitude of the prediction
    (e.g., are flood level predictions rising faster in already high areas?).

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Provides a compact overview comparing the rate of change across many
    locations or samples.
* Radial distance gives an intuitive sense of the magnitude of change
    (velocity).
* Color adds a critical second layer of information, either directional change
    or contextual magnitude.
* Facilitates spotting spatial patterns or clusters related to the dynamics
    of the prediction.
