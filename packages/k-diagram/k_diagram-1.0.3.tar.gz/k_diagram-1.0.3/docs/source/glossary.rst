This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the
`k-diagram` documentation and package.

   :sorted:

   ACov (Angular Coverage)
     A parameter (`acov`) controlling the angular span of the polar
     plots, such as 'default' (360°), 'half_circle' (180°),
     'quarter_circle' (90°), or 'eighth_circle' (45°).

   Anomaly (Prediction)
     An instance where the observed (actual) value falls outside the
     predicted uncertainty interval (i.e., below Qlow or above Qup).
     Visualized by :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_anomaly_magnitude`.

   Anomaly Magnitude
     The severity of a prediction anomaly, measured as the absolute
     distance between the actual value and the nearest violated
     prediction interval bound.

   Calibration (Interval)
     The degree to which the empirical coverage rate of prediction
     intervals matches their nominal coverage rate. A well-calibrated
     90% interval should cover approximately 90% of the actual values.

   Consistency (Interval Width)
     The stability or variability of the prediction interval width
     (Qup - Qlow) for a specific location or sample across multiple
     time steps or forecast horizons. Assessed by
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_consistency`.

   Coverage (Empirical)
     The actual fraction or percentage of observed (true) values that
     fall within their corresponding prediction intervals in a given
     dataset. Calculated by :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage`
     and visualized point-wise by
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage_diagnostic`.

   Coverage (Nominal)
     The theoretical or intended coverage rate of a prediction interval,
     determined by the quantile levels used. For example, the interval
     between the 10th (Q10) and 90th (Q90) percentiles has a nominal
     coverage of 80%.

   Drift (Model / Concept)
     The degradation or change in a model's performance or underlying
     data relationships over time or changing conditions.

   Drift (Uncertainty)
     The change in the magnitude or pattern of predicted uncertainty
     (typically interval width) over time or forecast horizons.
     Visualized by :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift`
     (average drift) and
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_uncertainty_drift` (pattern drift).

   Fingerprint (Feature)
     A characteristic profile of feature importance values for a specific
     model, time period, or group, often visualized using a radar chart via
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_fingerprint`.

   Interval Width
     The difference between the upper quantile (Qup) and lower quantile
     (Qlow) of a prediction interval, representing the magnitude of
     predicted uncertainty. Visualized by
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_width`.

   K-Diagram
     The term used for the specialized polar diagnostic plots generated
     by this package, named after the author (Kouadio).

   Polar Plot / Coordinates
     A graphical system where points are located by an angle (theta, θ)
     and a distance from a central point (radius, r). Used extensively
     in `k-diagram`.

   Prediction Interval (PI)
     A range [Qlow, Qup] derived from quantile forecasts, intended to
     contain the actual observed value with a certain probability
     (nominal coverage).

   Quantile
     A value below which a certain proportion of the data or probability
     distribution falls. Common examples used in forecasting are Q10 (10th
     percentile), Q50 (50th percentile or median), and Q90 (90th
     percentile).

   Radar Chart
     A type of polar plot where multiple quantitative variables
     (represented by axes radiating from the center) are shown for one
     or more observations (represented by polygons or lines). Used by
     :func:`~kdiagram.plot.feature_based.plot_feature_fingerprint` and
     optionally by :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage`.

   RMSD (Centered Root Mean Square Difference)
     A metric implicitly represented on a Taylor Diagram as the distance
     between a model point and the reference point. It measures the overall
     difference considering both standard deviation and correlation.

   Taylor Diagram
     A polar-style diagram summarizing model skill by plotting standard
     deviation (radius), correlation (angle), and RMSD (distance from
     reference) relative to observed data. Generated by functions in
     :mod:`kdiagram.plot.evaluation`.

   Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)
     The process of estimating and characterizing the uncertainty
     associated with model predictions, simulations, or measurements.

   Velocity (Prediction)
     The average rate of change of the central prediction estimate (e.g.,
     Q50) over consecutive time steps for a given location or sample.
     Visualized by :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_velocity`.
