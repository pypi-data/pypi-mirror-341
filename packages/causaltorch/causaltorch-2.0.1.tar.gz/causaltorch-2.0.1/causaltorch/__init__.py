"""
CausalTorch: Causal Neural-Symbolic Generative Networks
======================================================

A PyTorch library for building generative models with causal constraints.

Key components:
- Native causal transformer models for text, image, and video generation
- Graph-based causal rule definition and visualization
- Specialized neural layers for enforcing causal constraints
- Ethics by architecture - built-in ethical constraints
- Meta-learning for dynamic architecture generation
- Federated learning with causal knowledge sharing
- Creative computation through counterfactual reasoning
