"""
CausalTorch: Causality-infused Deep Learning Library
===================================================

CausalTorch provides tools for integrating causal inference and reasoning with
deep learning models. It enables researchers and practitioners to build
models that respect causal relationships in data, perform interventions,
and generate counterfactual examples.

Main Components:
- `models`: Causal deep learning models with native causal reasoning
- `rules`: Tooling for specifying and enforcing causal rules
- `ethics`: Ethical constraints and governance for causal AI
- `federated`: Distributed causal learning components
- `creative`: Tools for causal creativity and counterfactual imagination
- `multimodal`: Multimodal causal learning across text, images, and more
