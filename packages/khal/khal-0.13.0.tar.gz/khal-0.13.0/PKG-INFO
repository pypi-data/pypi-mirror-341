*Khal* is a standards based CLI and terminal calendar program, able to synchronize
with CalDAV_ servers through vdirsyncer_.

.. image:: http://lostpackets.de/images/khal.png

Features
--------
(or rather: limitations)

- khal can read and write events/icalendars to vdir_, so vdirsyncer_ can be
  used to `synchronize calendars with a variety of other programs`__, for
  example CalDAV_ servers.
- fast and easy way to add new events
- ikhal (interactive khal) lets you browse and edit calendars and events
- no support for editing the timezones of events yet
- works with python 3.9+
- khal should run on all major operating systems [1]_

.. [1] except for Microsoft Windows

Feedback
--------
Please do provide feedback if *khal* works for you or even more importantly if
it doesn't. The preferred way to get in contact (especially if something isn't
working) is via github or via IRC (#pimutils on Libera.Chat).
