    """Agent Transport

    A Transport is a means of communicating with an Agent. It is responsible for sending
    and receiving messages from the backend. It needs to implement the following methods:

    list_provision: Getting the list of active provisions from the backend. (depends on the backend)
    list_assignation: Getting the list of active assignations from the backend. (depends on the backend)

    change_assignation: Changing the status of an assignation. (depends on the backend)
    change_provision: Changing the status of an provision. (depends on the backend)

    broadcast: Configuring the callbacks for the transport on new assignation, unassignation provision and unprovison.

    if it is a stateful connection it can also implement the following methods:

    aconnect
    adisconnect
