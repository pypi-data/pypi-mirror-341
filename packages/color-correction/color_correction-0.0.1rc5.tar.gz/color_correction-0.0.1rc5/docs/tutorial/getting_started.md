## âœ¨ Introduction

In computer vision projects, maintaining consistent color representation is crucial for reliable results. Variations in color can affect tasks from object detection to image segmentation. Instead of treating color correction as an afterthought, it serves as a fundamental step for enhancing image analysis.

Images captured under different lighting or camera settings can exhibit significant color differences. Correcting these variations simplifies analysis and improves the overall performance of vision models.

In light of the need for consistent color representation outlined above, this package, [color-correction](https://agfianf.github.io/color-correction/), offers a robust solution for calibrating colors. It uses a set of reference patches from a 24-patch color checker to streamline the calibration process, ensuring that colors across diverse lighting conditions align accurately. This facilitates more reliable image analysis and enhances the overall performance of computer vision projects.
