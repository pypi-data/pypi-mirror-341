XNAT is a flexible imaging informatics software platform for organizing and managing 
imaging data. DAX is a Python project that provides a uniform interface to run 
pipelines on a cluster by pulling data from an XNAT database via REST API calls. 
The dax client further enhances DAX by offering powerful command-line tools that 
streamline extracting information from XNAT, creating pipelines (spiders/processors), 
building projects on XNAT with pipeline assessors, managing pipeline execution on a cluster, 
and automatically uploading results back to XNAT. By leveraging XnatUtils commands, 
the dax client also enables a programmatic workflow for interacting directly with XNAT in Python.
