# Keylex

Keylex is a Python library designed for efficient and flexible keyword extraction and matching. It supports various techniques, from basic exact matching to advanced fuzzy matching, with options for industry-specific and domain-tailored use cases. The library provides extensibility through custom matchers and extractors, making it an excellent choice for NLP applications like news article analysis, content classification, and keyword detection.

## Features

- **NER Integration**: Leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting entities from text.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Incorporates fuzzy matching using techniques like Levenshtein distance.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable with custom matchers and extractors.
