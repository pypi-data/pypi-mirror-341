# üå± Greening

`greening` is an opinionated, full-stack project automation tool for solo developers and creative coders.

With just a few commands, you can scaffold a production-ready Python package complete with docs, tests, GitHub Actions workflows, PyPI packaging, and an auto-deployed GitHub Pages site.
No boilerplate or setup hell, just instant polish.

## üçÉ Why `greening`? <a name="why-greening"></a>

Most devs never ship their tools. Not because the code isn‚Äôt good, but because the surrounding friction is too high:

- How do I structure the project?
- How do I set up CI/CD, tests, and linting?
- How do I make it look legit?
- How do I talk about it?

`greening` answers all of that in **one opinionated workflow**.

## üåø Key features <a name="key-features"></a>

`greening` automates your project creation pipeline:

‚úÖ `greening init` - generates a starter `greening.yaml` config file
‚úÖ `greening new` - scaffolds your entire Python project in-place
‚úÖ `greening deploy` - builds and pushes a polished GitHub Pages site

Additional features:

- Automatically initializes a Git repo
- Optionally creates a GitHub repository via API
- Optionally pushes to GitHub (main branch)
- Injects metadata throughout the project using Cookiecutter
- Uses Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes for clean, brandable documentation
- Auto-documentation with Sphinx + Read the Docs support
- Automatically wire in Google Analytics if configured

## üå≤ Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### 1. Install `greening`

```bash
pip install greening
```

### 2. Run `greening init`

This creates a starter config file in your current directory:

```
greening init
```

It generates `greening.yaml`:

```yaml
project_name: Test project
project_slug: test_project
github_username: chris-greening
author_name: Chris Greening
email: chris@christophergreening.com

# git_remote: git@github.com:chris-greening/test-repo.git
push: false
create_github_repo: true
```

### 3. Scaffold the project

Run this in the same directory as your config:

```
greening new
```

`greening` will generate your project in-place and optionally push it to GitHub.

### 4. Deploy the GitHub Pages site

```
greening deploy
```

This builds a static site using your config and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## üåª GitHub authentication <a name="github-authentication"></a>

To enable GitHub repo creation and pushing:

1. [Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Add it to your shell config:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then run:

```
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

## üå¥ Roadmap <a name="roadmap"></a>

A focused, opinionated roadmap toward making Greening the most seamless developer automation tool for launching and shipping polished open source projects.

- Plugin ecosystem to support custom features, commands, etc. within the greening command-line tool
- Custom template support for creating tailor-made templates
- Idempotent execution so commands are safe to run repeatedly with no unexpected side effects
- Cleanup partial builds in the event of a command failure to prevent half-baked launches
