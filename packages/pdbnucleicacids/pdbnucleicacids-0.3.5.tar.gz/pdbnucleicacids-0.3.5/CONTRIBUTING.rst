Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up PDBNucleicAcids for local development.

1. Fork the PDBNucleicAcids repo on Gitlab.
2. Clone your fork locally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@gitlab.com:your_name_here/pdbnucleicacids.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
   virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for
   local development:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkvirtualenv pdbnucleicacids
    $ cd pdbnucleicacids/
    $ make requirements-dev

4. Create a branch for local development:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make lint
    $ make test
    $ make test-all

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the Gitlab website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13
   and for PyPy. Make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest tests.test_pdbnucleicacids

To run all tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ bump-my-version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
    $ git push
    $ git push --tags
