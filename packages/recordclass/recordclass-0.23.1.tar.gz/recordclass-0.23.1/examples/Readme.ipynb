    "The instances of such classes have not `PyGC_Head` prefix in the memory, which decrease their size.\n",
    "This may make sense in cases where it is necessary to limit the size of objects as much as possible, provided that they will never be part of circular references in the application.\n",
    "For example, when an object represents a record with fields that represent simple values by convention (`int`, `float`, `str`, `date`/`time`/`datetime`, `timedelta`, etc.).\n",
    "Another examples are non-recursive data structures in which all leaf elements represent simple values.\n",
    "Of course, in python, nothing prevents you from â€œshooting yourself in the foot\" by creating the reference cycle in the script or application code.\n",

It's memory footprint is similar to memory footprint of instances of the classes with `__slots__` . The difference is equal to the size of `PyGC_Head`.
