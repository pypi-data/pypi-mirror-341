# NERDD Module

This package provides the basis to implement molecular prediction modules in the
NERDD ecosystem.

## Installation

``` bash
pip install -U nerdd-module
```


## Contribute

1. Fork and clone the code
2. Install test dependencies with `pip install -e .[test,dev,csp]` 
3. Install pre-commit hooks `pre-commit install`
4. Run tests via `pytest` or `pytest-watch` (short: `ptw`)
5. Build docs via `pip install -e .[docs]`  and `mkdocs serve`
