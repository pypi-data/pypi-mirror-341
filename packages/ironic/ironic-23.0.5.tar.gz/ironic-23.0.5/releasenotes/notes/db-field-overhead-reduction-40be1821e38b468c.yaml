    Slow database retrieval of nodes has been addressed at the lower layer by
    explicitly passing and handling only the requested fields. The result is
    excess discarded work is not performed, making the overall process more
    efficent.
    This is particullarly beneficial for OpenStack Nova's syncronization with
    Ironic.
