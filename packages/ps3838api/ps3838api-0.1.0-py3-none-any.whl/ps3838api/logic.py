def merge_odds_response(old: OddsResponse, new: OddsResponse) -> OddsResponse:
    """
    Merge a snapshot OddsResponse (old) with a delta OddsResponse (new).
    - Leagues are matched by league["id"].
    - Events are matched by event["id"].
    - Periods are matched by period["number"].
    - Any period present in 'new' entirely replaces the same period number in 'old'.
    - Periods not present in 'new' remain as they were in 'old'.

    Returns a merged OddsResponse that includes updated odds and periods, retaining
    old entries when no changes were reported in the delta.
