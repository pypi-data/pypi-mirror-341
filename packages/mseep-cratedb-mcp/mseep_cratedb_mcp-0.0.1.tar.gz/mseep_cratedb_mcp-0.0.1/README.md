# About
Model Context Protocol [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a protocol that standardizes providing
context to LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT and MistralAI.

CrateDB MCP server lets these LLMs operate directly on CrateDB enabling use cases like:

- Answer questions about your data and database state
- Help you debug and optimize queries directly on the database

To use a MCP server you need a [client that supports] the protocol, the most notable ones are: 
Claude Desktop, ChatGTP desktop, OPenAI agents SDK and Cursor.

# Examples
For questions like optimizing queries and CrateDB specific syntax/capabilities, we encourage the
LLMs to fetch `https://cratedb.com/docs` to offer the most accurate possible information.

These are examples of questions that have been tested and validated by the team. Remember that
LLMs can still hallucinate and give incorrect answers.

* Optimize this query: "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_date > '2012-12-1' AND revenue"
* Tell me about the health of the cluster
* What is the storage consumption of my tables, give it in a graph.
* How can I format a timestamp column to '2019 Jan 21'.

# Data integrity
We do not recommend letting the LLMs insert data or modify columns by itself, as such we tell the
LLMs to only allow 'SELECT' statements in the `cratedb_sql` tool, you can jailbreak this against
our recommendation.
