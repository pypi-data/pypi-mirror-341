# FactorialHR api python wrapper

This package provides a python wrapper to the [api of FactorialHR](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/docs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently only the get requests responses are modeled with pydantic

## Usage

Get all employees
```python
import factorialhr

authorizer = factorialhr.ApiKeyAuth('<api_key>')  # checkout other authorization methods
async with factorialhr.ApiClient(auth=authorizer) as api:
    employee_endpoint = factorialhr.EmployeeEndpoint(api)
    all_employees = await employee_endpoint.all()  # fetches all employees. on big companies you might want to increase the timeout by using timeout=httpx.Timeout(...)
```
Get a dictionary with team id as key and a list of member as value
```python
import asyncio

import factorialhr

authorizer = factorialhr.AccessTokenAuth('<access_token>')  # checkout other authorization methods
async with factorialhr.ApiClient(auth=authorizer) as api:
        employees_endpoint = factorialhr.EmployeeEndpoint(api)
        teams_endpoint = factorialhr.TeamEndpoint(api)
        all_employees, all_teams = await asyncio.gather(employees_endpoint.all(), teams_endpoint.all())  # remember to increase the timeout if you have a lot of employees or teams
        employees_by_team_id = {team.id: [employee for employee in all_employees if employee.id in team.employee_ids] for team in all_teams}
```

### Different request than `GET`

Update an employee
```python
import factorialhr

async with factorialhr.ApiClient(...) as api:
    response = await api.put(factorialhr.EmployeeEndpoint.endpoint, '<employee_id>', data={ 'first_name': 'Alice', ... })
```

## CLI

A commandline interface can be installed with `factorialhr[cli]`. This is especially useful as a uv tool `uv tool install factorialhr[cli]`.

`(uvx) factorialhr --help`

### Login

The cli currently only supports oauth2 as login method. Please create an issue or contribute yourself if you need a different login method.

`(uvx) factorialhr account login`
