## Requirements

In order to use Q Developer in JupyterLab, you must have a version of JupyterLab >= 4 installed. You will also need a free [AWS Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/sign-in-aws_builder_id.html) account to access Q Developer. (You can set that up the first time you log in.)

In order to use Q Developer in SageMaker Studio, you must have set up a SageMaker Studio notebook instance, along with an execution role with the appropriate IAM Permissions. 

## Getting Started

Install [JupyterLab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab) on your computer or if you already have JupyterLab installed, check it’s version by running the following command.

```
pip show jupyterlab
```

Note the version in the response, and follow the use the corresponding directions in one of the following sections.

### Installation Using Pip for Jupyter Lab version >= 4.0

You can install and enable the Q Developer extension for JupyterLab 4 with the following commands. 

```
# JupyterLab 4
pip install amazon-q-developer-jupyterlab-ext
```

Once installed, choose ****Get Started**** from the Amazon Q panel at the bottom of the window. This will enable to you log in to [AWS Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/sign-in-aws_builder_id.html) to access Amazon Q Developer. Refer to [Setting up Q Developer with JupyterLab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/jupyterlab-setup.html) for detailed setup instructions.

### SageMaker Studio

To setup the Q Developer extension with a SageMaker Studio notebook instance, you must add IAM Permissions for 
`codewhisperer:GenerateRecommendations` for your user profile. Then you must install and enable the extension with the following commands.

```
conda activate studio
pip install amazon-q-developer-jupyterlab-ext~=1.0
jupyter server extension enable amazon_q_developer_jupyterlab_ext
conda deactivate
restart-jupyter-server
```

After you complete installation and refresh your browser, an Amazon Q panel will appear at the bottom of the window. Refer to [Setting up Q Developer with SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/sagemaker-setup.html) for detailed setup instructions. 

## Features

### Code Completion

Q Developer for JupyterLab provides AI powered suggestions as ghost text with the following default keybindings. These can be modified in the settings.


|              Action	                  |      Key Binding       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Manually trigger Q Developer | Alt C (Window) / ⌥ C (Mac)        |
| Accept a recommendation        | Tab       |
| Next recommendation            | Right arrow |
| Previous recommendation        | Left arrow  |
| Reject a recommendation        | ESC         |



Python is the only supported programming language for now. Users can start or pause suggestions by toggling the menu item in the Amazon Q panel that will appear at the bottom of the window.

### Code References

With the reference log, you can view references to code recommendations. You can also update and edit code recommendations suggested by Q Developer.

To view Code References for accepted suggestions, choose **Open Code Reference Log** from the Amazon Q panel at the bottom of the window. Users can also turn off code suggestions with code references in Settings.
