# GFAGraphs - A Python GFA library

This Python library aims to be an abstraction layer for GFA file format.

> [!WARNING]\
> `gfagraphs` is not actively maintained as I moved to Rust for my main research work. However, as the library is used in some projects, the library remains available as is.

## Package `gfagraphs`

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/874430800802754623/1179353568105467964/library.png)

The package is organized in 4 modules:
+ `gfagraphs.abstractions` contains abstractions over GFA formats
+ `gfagraphs.gfaparser` contains an abstract class for parsing and saving GFA file format
+ `gfagraphs.graph` contains the main `Graph` class that represents a GFA graph in memory, and edit functions
+ `gfagraphs.networkx` conains an abstract class for visualization and modelization of GFA in a NetworkX object
