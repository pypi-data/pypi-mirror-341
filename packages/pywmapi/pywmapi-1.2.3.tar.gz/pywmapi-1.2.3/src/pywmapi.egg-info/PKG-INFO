There are more APIs that are not recorded in the official documentation. Once all the above APIs are done, we would get on these undocumented APIs ASAP.

**According to the official API documentation, there's a limit on the API that could only be called 3 times per sec. Otherwise, the request may be blocked by the cloudflare.**

## Installation

```
pip install pywmapi
```

The version of Python **MUST >= 3.7** since `dataclasses` is used.

## Guidance

package of pywmapi is structured as:
```
.
├── auth
├── common
├── exceptions
├── experimental
│   └── auctions
├── items
├── lang
├── liches
├── orders
├── profile
├── rivens
├── statistics
└── utils.py
```

* `auth`: authentication such as signin
* `experimental`: experimental functionalities
  * `auctions`: auctions related
* `items`: item related
* `liches` lich related
* `orders`: orders manipulation
* `profile`: user profile manipulation
* `rivens`: riven related
* `statistics`: statistics of items

💪 *More functionalities is coming!*

🏗️ *Better documentation is under construction!*

The param `url_name` of some functions is regarded as the unique name for each item. For instance, if I search for the item *Chroma Prime Systems* on warframe market, the url for this page become *https://warframe.market/items/chroma_prime_systems*. And the last part of this url string is exactly the `url_name` for this item, i.e. `chroma_prime_systems`!

Another way to get `url_name` for an item is through the `items.list_items()` function.

### Examples

First, we import the package as:
```python
import pywmapi as wm
```

To list all of the tradable items:
```python
wm.items.list_items()
```

To get the info for any item with its `url_name`:
```python
wm.items.get_item("chroma_prime_systems")
```

To get the orders of a specific item:
```python
wm.items.get_orders("chroma_prime_systems")
```

To create order:
```python
sess = wm.auth.signin("your_account", "your_password")
# new selling order item of "Flame Gland" for 1000 platinum, quantity 1, rank 0 and invisible
new_item = wm.orders.OrderNewItem(
    item_id="5be5f5a23ffcc7038857f119",
    order_type=wm.common.OrderType.sell,
    platinum=1000,
    quantity=1,
    rank=0,
    visible=False,
)
new_order = wm.orders.add_order(sess, new_item)
```

To get the statistics of historical prices of any item:
```python
wm.statistics.get_statistic("chroma_prime_systems")
```

Signin & get current orders:
```python
sess = wm.auth.signin("your_account", "your_password")
sell_orders, buy_orders = wm.orders.get_current_orders(sess)
```

To get all rivens templates:
```python
wm.rivens.list_items()
```

Some of these function may have various optional params, such as `platform`, `lang`, `include`, etc.

More APIs and docs could be found in corresponding packages and docstrings.
