The state-of-the-art BME690 breakout lets you measure temperature, pressure, humidity, and indoor air quality.

## Installing

### Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your BME690
up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/bme690-python
cd bme690-python
./install.sh
```

**Note** Libraries will be installed in the "pimoroni" virtual environment, you will need to activate it to run examples:

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/pimoroni/bin/activate
```

### Development:

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by having the latest code, you can install the development version like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/bme690-python
cd bme690-python
./install.sh --unstable
```

In all cases you will have to enable the i2c bus:

```
sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
```
