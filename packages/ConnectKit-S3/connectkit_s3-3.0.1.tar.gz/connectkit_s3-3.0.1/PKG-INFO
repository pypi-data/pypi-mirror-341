# ConnectKit S3 [*en*|[ru](https://github.com/mtuciru/ConnectKit-S3/blob/3.0.1/README_RU.md)]

___

ConnectKit S3 is a wrapper for boto3 and aioboto3 to simplify working with S3 storages.

Includes pydantic settings, template code.

## Installation

___

To install the sync version:

```shell
pip install ConnectKit-S3
```

To install the async version:

```shell
pip install ConnectKit-S3[async]
```

## Usage

___
These variables from settings are used for connection by default.
All variables are optional.

The first three are responsible for setting up the default connection,
you need to specify everything to enable it.

Bucket and region are used by default unless another one is specified in connection.

Variables are extracted from the environment or `.env` file:

    AWS_HOST=str               # Address of S3 server
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=str      # Access key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=str  # Secret key
    AWS_REGION=str             # Region, optional
    AWS_BUCKET=str             # Default bucket

The `s3` and `async_s3` functions are used to open the connection.

Uploading and downloading files requires:

* Synchronous mode requires a synchronous file descriptor open in binary mode.
* Asynchronous mode requires a synchronous or aiofiles binary file descriptor

```python
from s3 import s3
from s3.asyncio import async_s3

# Synchronous
client = s3()
if client.has_file("s3_filename"):
    pass

# Asynchronous
client = await async_s3()

async with client() as conn:
    if conn.has_file("s3_filename"):
        pass
```
