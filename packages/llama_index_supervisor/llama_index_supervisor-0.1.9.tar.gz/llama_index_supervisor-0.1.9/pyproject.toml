description = "This project is a Python-based multi-agent supervisor inspired by LangGraph, adapted for llama_index. It delegates tasks to specialized agents and tools, processes function-calling LLM responses, and manages conversation history. The structured workflow handles tool calls, processes agent handoffs with error handling, and provides flexible message management for hierarchical multi-agent systems."
