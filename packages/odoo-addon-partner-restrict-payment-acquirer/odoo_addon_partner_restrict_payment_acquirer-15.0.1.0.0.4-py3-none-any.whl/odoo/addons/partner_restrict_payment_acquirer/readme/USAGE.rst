Open the partner form and go to the `Sales & Purchases` tab. Add payment acquirers in the `Allowed Acquirers` field.
When the partner opens an invoice or a sales order in the portal, only the allowed acquirers will be available for payment.

Note: Leaving this field empty will remove any restrictions, allowing the selection of any acquirer.
