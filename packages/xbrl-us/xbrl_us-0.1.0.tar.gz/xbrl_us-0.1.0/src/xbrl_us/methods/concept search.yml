description: Search for XBRL concept details for a given DTS, or across a set of taxonomies.
  If searching for concept details it highly recommended that a DTS identifier is used to
  limit the concept search, especially when returning label data. For example, if no DTS
  is prescribed and the details of Assets are requested, the API will attempt to return
  all the labels used for Assets in every single filing made.
long_description: The DTS layer of the financial reporting taxonomy architecture encompasses
  the scope, syntax, naming and documentation relating to a DTS whose starting point is a
  given taxonomy schema.
  A **concept** is a taxonomy element that provides the meaning for a fact.
  For example, "Profit", "Turnover", and "Assets" would be typical concepts.
  Approximate technical term, concept (XBRL v2.1) or primary item (XBRL Dimensions).
  Concept, as defined here, excludes header and structural element. The term "Line Item"
  will sometimes be used to refer to a concept.
