    """
    Deinterlace images collected using resonance-scanning microscopes such that the
    forward and backward-scanned lines are properly aligned. A fourier-approach is
    utilized: the fourier transform of the two sets of lines is computed to calculate
    the cross-power spectral density. Taking the inverse fourier transform of the
    cross-power spectral density yields a matrix whose peak corresponds to the
    sub-pixel offset between the two sets of lines. This translative offset was then
    discretized and used to shift the backward-scanned lines.

    Unfortunately, the fast-fourier transform methods that underlie the implementation
    of the deinterlacing algorithm have poor spatial complexity
    (i.e., large memory constraints). This weakness is particularly problematic when
    using GPU-parallelization. To mitigate these issues, deinterlacing can be performed
    batch-wise while maintaining numerically identical results (see `block_size`).

    To improve performance, the deinterlacing algorithm can be applied to a pool
    of the images while maintaining efficacy. Specifically, setting the `pool`
    parameter will apply the deinterlacing algorithm to the the standard deviation of
    each pixel across a block of images. This approach is better suited to images with
    limited signal-to-noise or sparse activity than simply operating on every n-th
    frame.

    Finally, it is often the case that the auto-alignment algorithms used in microscopy
    software are unstable until a sufficient number of frames have been collected.
    Therefore, the `unstable` parameter can be used to specify the number of frames
    that should be deinterlaced individually before switching to batch-wise processing.

    .. note::
        This function operates in-place.

    .. warning::
        The number of frames included in each fourier transform must be several times
        smaller than the maximum number of frames that fit within your GPU's VRAM
        (`CuPy <https://cupy.dev>`_) or RAM (`NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_). This
        function will not automatically revert to the NumPy implementation if there is
        not sufficient VRAM. Instead, an out of memory error will be raised.
