CWInPy is a Python package designed to perform searches for, and inference on, `continuous
quasi-monochromatic gravitational-wave signals <https://www.ligo.org/science/GW-Continuous.php>`_.
In particular, signals that might be emitted by non-axisymmetric and rapidly rotating `neutron stars
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star>`_, such as `pulsars
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar>`_. CWInPy stands for "\ **C**\ ontinuous (gravitational) **W**\ ave
**In**\ ference in **Py**\ thon".

The package provides tools for processing raw gravitational-wave strain time-series data based on
the phase evolution of a given source (using a `Tempo
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo_(astronomy)>`_-style parameter file); a class to store and
display this data is available. Following data processing, the package provides tools for inferring
the unknown gravitational-wave parameters describing the source and its orientation. An integrated
pipeline combining both these stages (``cwinpy_knope``) is also provided. These tools are all
available through command line executables and through a Python API. The pipelines can generate
`HTCondor <https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ `DAGs
<https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/dagman-workflows.html>`_ to run analyses
over long observing runs for multiple detectors and multiple sources on a computer cluster or via
the Open Science Grid. The pipelines can be used on both open data (as hosted by the
`Gravitational-wave Open Science Center <https://gwosc.org/data/>`_) and proprietary
data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors.

In addition to these main functions, CWInPy enables users to:

* simulate processed signals from :ref:`individual sources<Simulating a signal>` or
  :ref:`populations<Pulsar simulations>` of sources;
* perform :ref:`hierarchical inference<Hierarchical analyses>` on the underlying ellipticity/mass
  quadrupole distribution for multiple sources.
