Python library for making text predictions using a language model.

**** Setting up a Python environment ****
These instructions are the same as those in the classify-aac which actually does training of models.
But the same environment should also work for evaluation using the models (though you may only need a subset of the packages).
This was tested on cheetah on 9/14/24.

If you don't have anaconda installed in your user account you'll first need to do that.
See: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
