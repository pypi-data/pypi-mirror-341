           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Data converters

This repository provides the source code for Evo-specific data converters.

When running a converter, data is imported from a supported file format, converted into geoscience objects, and then published to the Seequent Evo API.

The existing data converters can be used without modification or used as a template for your own integration.

## Pre-requisites

* Python >= 3.10, <= 3.12

## Installation

```
pip install evo-data-converters
```

## Usage

The top level sections for the repository are as follows.

- [Samples](samples/README.md) - Jupyter notebook examples for importing data with the existing data converters
- [Data Converters](src/evo/data_converters/README.md) - Source code for the data converters module (`evo.data_converters`)
- Scripts - helper scripts for working with different types of data files
- Tests - unit tests for the data converter module

### Evo authorisation and discovery

Whether using the converters or undertaking development work on the modules themselves, integration with Evo will require that you are granted access as an Evo Partner or Customer, along with access to a specific Evo Workspace. Access is granted via a token. For more information on getting started, see the [Seequent Evo Developer Portal.](https://developer.seequent.com/)

### Using the data converters
See the documentation for each converter for information on how to use the data converters to upload or download geoscience objects from Seequent Evo.

Currently supported converters are:
 * [OMF](/src/evo/data_converters/omf/README.md)
 * [RESQML](/src/evo/data_converters/resqml/README.md)
 * [VTK](/src/evo/data_converters/vtk/README.md)
 * [UBC](/src/evo/data_converters/ubc/README.md)
 * [GOCAD](/src/evo/data_converters/gocad/README.md)

 To use any of the data converters, you will need a few things:
  * An *access token* for your user
  * The *organisation ID*, *hub URL* and *workspace ID* that you would like to import your data to, or export it from.

To get an access token, see [Apps and Tokens](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens/) in the Seequent Evo Developer portal.

To find the URL of your hub, and the ID of your organisation, see [Evo Discovery.](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/discovery/)

For information on accessing and listing Workspaces, see [Workspaces.](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/workspaces/)

There is more information in the [Welcome to Seequent Evo](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/) area of the Developer portal, so take a look there or ask questions in the [Community forum.](https://community.seequent.com/categories/evo)

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Seequent software. Please have a look over our [contribution guide.](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Using uv

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage all the Python
versions, packages etc.

Run `uv sync --all-extras` to install everything you need.

Then use `uv run <command>` to run commands.

```shell
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest tests
```

### evo-sdk-common
The `evo-sdk-common` Python library can be used to log in. An organisation, hub, and workspace can be then be used to publish objects.

```python
from evo.aio import AioTransport
from evo.common import APIConnector, BaseAPIClient
from evo.common.utils import BackoffIncremental
from evo.discovery import DiscoveryAPIClient
from evo.oauth import AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer, OIDCConnector
from evo.workspaces import WorkspaceAPIClient

# Configure the transport.
transport = AioTransport(
    user_agent="evo-client-common-poc",
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_method=BackoffIncremental(2),
    num_pools=4,
    verify_ssl=True,
)

# Login to the Evo platform.
# User Login
authorizer = AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer(
    redirect_url="<redirect_url>",
    oidc_connector=OIDCConnector(
        transport=transport,
        oidc_issuer="<issuer_url>",
        client_id="<client_id>",
    ),
)
await authorizer.login()

# Select an Organization.
async with APIConnector("https://discover.api.seequent.com", transport, authorizer) as api_connector:
    discovery_client = DiscoveryAPIClient(api_connector)
    organizations = await discovery_client.list_organizations()

selected_org = organizations[0]

# Select a hub and create a connector.
hub_connector = APIConnector(selected_org.hubs[0].url, transport, authorizer)

# Select a Workspace.
async with hub_connector:
    workspace_client = WorkspaceAPIClient(hub_connector, selected_org.id)
    workspaces = await workspace_client.list_workspaces()

workspace = workspaces[0]
workspace_env = workspace.get_environment()

# Interact with a service.
async with hub_connector:
    service_client = BaseAPIClient(workspace_env, hub_connector)
    ...
```

### Developing converters

See [Data converters](/src/evo/data_converters/README.md) for information on how to work on the Evo Data Converters.
This includes both importers and exporters.

We encourage both extending the functionality of the existing converters, or adding new ones for the object formats you would like to see.

## Code of conduct

We rely on an open, friendly, inclusive environment. To help us ensure this remains possible, please familiarise yourself with our [code of conduct.](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
