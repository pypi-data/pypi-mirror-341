# any-agents

**Note: This is not the package you're looking for!**

You probably meant to install `any-agent` (without the 's').

This package exists only to redirect users to the correct package and will automatically install the proper `any-agent` package as a dependency.

## Correct Usage

```python
# WRONG - Don't do this
import any_agents

# CORRECT - Do this instead
import any_agent
```
