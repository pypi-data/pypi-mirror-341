"""
Classes for loading and managing plugins. 

See also the 'plugin' module.

Note: Referring to 'MasterPiece' modules as plugins may not fully do them justice, 
as the term 'plugin' could imply that plugin classes are somehow less capable than 
core, built-in classes. However, this is far from the case. Don't let the terminology 
mislead you â€” plugin classes are not second-class citizens.

The only difference between plugin modules and the core set of MasterPiece modules is that 
plugins are dynamic by nature.  They can be added or removed without altering a single 
line of code in the main application. Plugin modules have the same level of control and 
capability as the core classes, offering 100% control over the application.

    If a plugin implements the `Plugin` interface, it is responsible for determining what objects
    should be added to the application.
