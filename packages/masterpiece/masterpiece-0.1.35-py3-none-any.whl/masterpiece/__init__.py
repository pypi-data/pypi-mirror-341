"""
This module exposes the core concrete classes of the framework, which are intended to be 
instantiated and used by application developers. 

The core package consists of two types of classes:

1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: These define the interfaces that framework implementors should 
    follow when creating subclasses. They provide method contracts that must be implemented by concrete 
    subclasses. These classes are **not intended to be instantiated** directly.

2. **Concrete Classes**: These are the classes that **can be instantiated** and used directly by application 
    developers. They represent fully implemented functionality and are ready for use in applications.

This structure ensures clear separation between the framework's core functionality and the classes that can be
used to build applications on top of the framework.
