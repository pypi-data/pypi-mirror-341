## Netbox Plugin which integrates [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) and [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/)! üöÄ

> **‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:** Proxbox is currently under development and **only performs read-only operations using `GET` requests**. There is **no functionality implemented to modify or change your Proxmox environment**, so there's **no risk of unintentional changes** being made by the plugin at this stage.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### TL'DR (For Experienced Users)

#### Enable plugin in configuration.py (usually on /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox)

```
PLUGINS = ['netbox_proxbox']
```

### Run the commands to install plugin

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate

# Install plugin
pip install netbox-proxbox==0.0.6b2

# Run migrations
cd /opt/netbox/netbox/
python3 manage.py migrate netbox_proxbox
python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart netbox
```

### Setup the backend

The backend can be on a different venv (virtual environment) as it is a completely different service.
The communication between the plugin and its backend is fully through API.

```
pip install proxbox-api
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800
```
