# FRAME-FEATURE-SELECTOR

FRAME-FEATURE-SELECTOR is a Python library that implements **FRAME** (Feature Ranking and Aggregation using Multiple Evaluators), a robust and interpretable feature selection technique for both classification and regression tasks. It allows practitioners and researchers to compare FRAME with other traditional feature selection methods and evaluate its performance on various datasets.

---

## 🧠 What is FRAME?

**FRAME** is a hybrid feature selection method that aggregates feature importance scores across multiple traditional techniques and model evaluations. Instead of relying on a single feature selector, FRAME combines the strengths of multiple evaluators (e.g., mutual information, Lasso, tree-based, recursive feature elimination) to produce a ranked list of features. This approach reduces bias, improves generalizability, and offers more reliable performance across diverse datasets.

## 📦 Installation

To install FRAME-FEATURE-SELECTOR from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parulkumari2707@gmail.com/FRAME-FEATURE-SELECTOR.git
cd FRAME-FEATURE-SELECTOR
pip install -e
```

# 🚀 Key Features
- 🔍 Hybrid feature selection using multiple evaluators.
- 🧪 Works for both classification and regression tasks.
- 📊 Evaluates and benchmarks multiple feature selectors including FRAME.
- 📁 Supports real-world and synthetic datasets.
- 📈 Outputs detailed performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, R², MSE, etc.).
- 📂 Modular and extensible design with scikit-learn-style API.
- 🧪 Built-in testing framework and dataset pipeline.

# ⚙️ How It Works
FRAME:
- Applies multiple feature selection techniques on a given dataset.
- Ranks features from each technique and aggregates them into a unified ranking.
- Selects the top-k (or thresholded) features for downstream model training.
- Evaluates and compares model performance across selectors.

#🧪 Example Usage
```bash
from frame.selector import FrameSelector
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Initialize FRAME
fs = FrameSelector(task="classification", top_k=5)

# Fit and transform data
X_selected = fs.fit_transform(X, y)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_selected, y)

```
