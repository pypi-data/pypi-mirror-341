            UTC time is refreshed. Defaults to 60 seconds.

    This function monitors a stream of events defined by a timestamp column and detects
    inactivity periods that exceed a specified threshold. Additionally, it identifies
    the first event that resumes activity after each period of inactivity.

    Note: Assumes that the ingested timestamps (event_time_column) follow current UTC time
    and that the latency of the system is negligible compared to the `allowed_inactivity_period`.

    Args:
        event_time_column: A reference to the column containing
            UTC timestamps of events in the monitored table.
        allowed_inactivity_period: The maximum allowed period of
            inactivity. If no events occur within this duration, an inactivity
            period is flagged.
        refresh_rate: The frequency at which the current time
            is refreshed for inactivity detection. Defaults to 1 second.

            The inactivity periods are computed separately per each `instance` value

              was detected).
            - **resumed_activities** (`pw.Table`): A table containing the earliest
