Blanket orders are useful to manage the sales of the same products to the same customers under the same conditions over a period of time. In some cases, such a contract may also
include the securement of the quantities of the products to be delivered.

This is achieved by using the OCA module [sale_stock_prebook](https://pypi.org/project/odoo-addon-sale--stock-prebook/).
