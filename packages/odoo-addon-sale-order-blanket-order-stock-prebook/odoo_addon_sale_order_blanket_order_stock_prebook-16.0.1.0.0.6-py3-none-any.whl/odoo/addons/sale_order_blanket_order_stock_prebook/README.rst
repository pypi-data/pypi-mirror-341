This module extends the functionality of Sale Blanket Order to support
the reservation of stock for future consumption by call-off orders and
therefore ensures that the quantities of the products to be delivered
are available when needed.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Blanket orders are useful to manage the sales of the same products to
the same customers under the same conditions over a period of time. In
some cases, such a contract may also include the securement of the
quantities of the products to be delivered.

This is achieved by using the OCA module
`sale_stock_prebook <https://pypi.org/project/odoo-addon-sale--stock-prebook/>`__.

Usage
=====

When you create a blanket order, you can choose a reservation strategy
to apply to the products of the order. With this addon installed, a new
strategy is available: "At Confirm". If you choose this strategy, the
stock will be reserved at the time of the blanket order confirmation for
a consumption starting at the validity start date of the blanket order.
