"""
IdentiTwin - Structural Vibration Monitoring Library

This package provides a comprehensive toolkit for monitoring structural health
and vibrations using various sensors like LVDTs and accelerometers, primarily
designed for deployment on platforms like Raspberry Pi but adaptable for simulation.

It includes modules for:
- System configuration (`configurator`)
- Sensor calibration (`calibration`)
- Core monitoring and data acquisition (`system_monitoring`)
- Real-time event detection (`event_monitoring`)
- Data processing and storage (`processing_data`)
- Data analysis and FFT (`processing_analysis`)
- Performance tracking (`performance_monitor`)
- Report generation (`report_generator`)
- Shared state management (`state`)
