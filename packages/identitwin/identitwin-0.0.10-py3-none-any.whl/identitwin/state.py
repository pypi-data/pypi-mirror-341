"""
State Management Module for IdentiTwin.

Provides thread-safe global dictionaries to manage the shared state across
different modules of the IdentiTwin monitoring system. This includes sensor status,
event tracking information, and configuration parameters. Locks are used to ensure
atomic updates and prevent race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

Key Features:
- Thread-safe access to shared state variables using locks.
- Separate dictionaries for sensor, event, and configuration states.
- Functions to get, set, and reset state variables.
