# 🤖 What is `pi_optimal`?

`pi_optimal` is an open-source Python library that helps you **model, optimize, and control complex systems through Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Whether your system involves advertising delivery, energy consumption, inventory management, or any scenario where sequential decision-making is paramount, `pi_optimal` provides a flexible and modular interface to train, evaluate, and deploy RL-based policies.

Built for data scientists, RL practitioners, and developers, `pi_optimal`:

- Offers a **time-series aware RL pipeline**, handling lookback windows and forecasting future states.
- Supports **various action spaces** (continuous, discrete, or multi-dimensional), enabling complex control strategies.
- Integrates easily with **custom reward functions**, empowering you to tailor the agent’s objectives to your business goals.
- Facilitates **multi-step planning**, allowing you to look ahead and optimize future outcomes, not just the immediate next step.

If you find `pi_optimal` useful, consider joining our [community](https://discord.com/invite/dYjDmjanQf) and give us a ⭐ on GitHub!

# 🎯 Why use `pi_optimal`?

In dynamic and complex systems, even experienced operators can struggle to find the best decisions at every step. `pi_optimal` helps you:

- **Automate Decision-Making:** Reduce human overhead by letting RL agents handle routine optimization tasks.
- **Optimize Performance Over Time:** Forecast system states and choose actions that yield smooth, cost-effective, or profit-maximizing trajectories.
- **Incorporate Uncertainty:** Account for uncertainty in future outcomes with built-in approaches to handle uncertain environments.
- **Seamlessly Integrate with Your Workflow:** `pi_optimal` fits easily with your existing code, data pipelines, and infrastructure.

---

# 🌐 Use Cases

- **Advertising Delivery Optimization:** Smooth out ad impressions over time, ensuring efficient, controlled delivery that meets pacing and budget constraints.
- **Energy Management:** Balance supply and demand, optimize resource allocation, and reduce operational costs.
- **Inventory and Supply Chain:** Manage stock levels, forecast demand, and plan orders for just-in-time deliveries.
- **Dynamic Pricing and Bidding:** Adjust bids, prices, and frequency caps in real-time to maximize revenue or reduce costs.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Installation
Install pi_optimal directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install pi-optimal
```
    
Once installed, you can explore the examples in the [notebooks](./notebooks) directory to see how to integrate pi_optimal into your projects.

## Example Usage

Below is a simplified excerpt demonstrating how `pi_optimal` can be applied to optimize ad delivery. For a more detailed walkthrough, refer to the [notebooks](./notebooks).

```python
import pandas as pd

from pi_optimal.agents.agent import Agent
from pi_optimal.datasets.timeseries_dataset import TimeseriesDataset
from pi_optimal.utils.trajectory_visualizer import TrajectoryVisualizer

# Load historical room climate control data
df_room_history = pd.read_csv('room_climate_history.csv')

# Prepare dataset: define states (e.g., room conditions), actions (e.g., heater settings), and reward (e.g., comfort level)
climate_dataset = TimeseriesDataset(
    df_room_history,
    state_columns=['temperature', 'humidity'],
    action_columns=['heater_power'],
    reward_column='comfort_score',
    timestep_column='timestamp',
    unit_index='room_id',
    lookback_timesteps=8
)

# Train a reinforcement learning agent for climate control
climate_agent = Agent()
climate_agent.train(dataset=climate_dataset)

# Load current room data to predict next actions
df_current_conditions = pd.read_csv('current_room_conditions.csv')
current_dataset = TimeseriesDataset(df_current_conditions,
                                                dataset_config=climate_dataset.dataset_config,
                                                train_processors=False,
                                                is_inference=True)

# Predict optimal heater settings for improved comfort
optimal_actions = climate_agent.predict(current_dataset)
print(optimal_actions)


# Playground to show simulated result of optimal actions and allows you to test different actions
trajectory_visualizer = TrajectoryVisualizer(agent, current_dataset, best_actions=best_actions)
trajectory_visualizer.display()
```

# 🔨 Development

If you want to contribute to `pi_optimal`, we recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies and environments. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Deactivate any active virtual environments**:  
   Ensure you are not already in a virtual environment (for example, use `conda deactivate` if you are using Conda).

2. **Install Poetry** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    pipx install poetry
    ```

3. **Clone the repository** and navigate into its directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pi-optimal/pi-optimal.git
    cd pi-optimal
    ```

4. **Install the project dependencies** using Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

**Note on PyTorch Versions**:

By default, pi_optimal installs the CPU-only version of PyTorch (pytorch-cpu).
If you'd like to use a CUDA-enabled (GPU) version of PyTorch, simply run:

```bash
poetry remove torch
poetry add torch@^2.3
```
This ensures you have the correct version of PyTorch for your system's GPU acceleration.

**Next Steps: Running Notebooks**

Once the installation is complete, you can open any notebook from the [notebooks](./notebooks) directory. When launching Jupyter, select the virtual environment created by Poetry (it should appear with a name similar to `pi-optimal-xyz-py3.10`).

If you don’t see this environment, you might need to run:
```bash
poetry run ipython kernel install --user --name=pi-optimal
```
This command will register your new environment as an option in Jupyter.

Now you’re all set—ready to code! 🚀
