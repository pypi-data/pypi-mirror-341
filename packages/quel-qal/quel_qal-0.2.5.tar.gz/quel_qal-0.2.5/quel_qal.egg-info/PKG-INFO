# QUEL-QAL: QUEL Quantitative Analysis Library
Welcome to **quel-qal**! This repository contains Python code for analyzing images of QUEL Imaging's fluorescence phantoms and obtaining relevant metrics about the capabilities of your fluorescence imaging system. Find more information about our fluorescence targets [on our website](https://shop.quelimaging.com/resources/). Documentation on how to use **quel-qal** to analyze images can be found in the `doc` folder and in the [Wiki](https://github.com/QUEL-Imaging/quel-qal/wiki).

## Getting Started
This guide will help you get started with setting up and using **quel-qal**. Follow the steps below to install directly from PyPI, or clone this repository locally. Conda installation is not currently supported.

### Prerequisites
- **Quel-qal** requires Python version â‰¥ 3.12.
- It is also recommended (though not required) to set up a separate virtual environment to install to. On your terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like to install the virtual environment. Create and activate a new virtual environment as follows.</br></br>

  On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
  On Windows:
  ```
  python -m venv env
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```
  If you will be working in an iPython environment (Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab), create and activate a virtual environment as described above, then do the following to install your virtual environment as a kernel for Jupyter (change `python` to `python3` in the last line accordingly):
  ```
  pip install jupyter
  pip install ipykernel
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=env --display-name="quel-qal_env"
  ```
  When you launch Jupyter you will see "quel-qal_env" as an option in the available kernels.

### PyPI Installation
You can install **quel-qal** directly from PyPI using:
```
pip install quel-qal
```
This will install **quel-qal** along with all its dependencies.

### GitHub Installation
Alternatively, you can install the repository from GitHub by following these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/QUEL-Imaging/quel-qal.git
    cd quel-qal
    ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional):**</br>
    Create and activate a virtual environment as described above.
3. **Install dependencies:**</br>
    You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Install quel-qal:**</br>
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```
