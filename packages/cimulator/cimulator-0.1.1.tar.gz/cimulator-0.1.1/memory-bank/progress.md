# Progress

## Current Status
The Cimulator project is in a functional state with core features implemented. Based on the codebase analysis, the project has implemented the key components outlined in the implementation plan:

- File loading and include resolution
- Job expansion with the `extends` mechanism
- Workflow and rule evaluation
- Variable expansion
- Pipeline simulation
- Command-line interface

The project is structured as a Python package with a clear modular architecture and has test files for various components.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Loading and parsing GitLab CI YAML files
- ✅ Recursively resolving and merging included YAML files
- ✅ Expanding job definitions using the `extends` mechanism
- ✅ Evaluating workflow rules to determine if a pipeline should run
- ✅ Expanding variables in job definitions
- ✅ Simulating pipeline execution based on configuration

### Command-Line Interface
- ✅ `validate` command for validating GitLab CI configuration
- ✅ `simulate` command for simulating pipeline execution

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for key components (loader, job expander, simulation engine)

## What's Left to Build

### Documentation
- ❌ User documentation (usage examples, configuration formats)
- ❌ Developer documentation (architecture, contributing guidelines)
- ❌ API documentation

### Features
- ❌ Detailed validation reporting (beyond basic YAML validation)
- ❌ Visualization of job dependencies and workflow
- ❌ Support for more GitLab CI features (e.g., `include:rules`, `parallel`, etc.)
- ❌ Performance optimizations for large configurations

### Testing
- ❌ More comprehensive test coverage
- ❌ Integration tests with real-world GitLab CI configurations
- ❌ Performance benchmarks

## Recent Improvements

1. **Fixed GitLab CI `!reference` Tag Support**: Implemented a custom reference resolution mechanism in the loader.py file that properly handles the GitLab CI `!reference` tag. This allows the tool to process YAML files that use this tag to reference parts of the document.

2. **Fixed Test Failure**: Modified the simulation_engine.py file to include global variables in the simulation summary, fixing the test_simulate_cli_with_profile test.

3. **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Added a new test specifically for the `!reference` tag functionality, ensuring that this feature works correctly.

4. **Improved CLI Output Handling**: Modified the CLI module to save the output of validate and simulate commands to files instead of printing to the terminal. This prevents overwhelming the terminal with large outputs and makes it easier to review and process the results.
   - Added `--output`/`-o` option to both commands to specify the output file path
   - Updated tests to verify the new behavior
   - Added user-friendly success messages that show the absolute path to the output file

5. **Enhanced Reference Tag Handling**: Improved the handling of GitLab CI `!reference` tags to resolve references after all includes are processed. This fixes issues with references across included files, such as filelists defined in template files being referenced in other files.
   - Modified the loader.py file to delay reference resolution until after all includes are resolved
   - Updated the test_reference_tag.py file to account for the new behavior
   - Verified that references across included files are now resolved correctly

6. **Added Configurable Logging Level**: Implemented a command-line option to control the verbosity of logging output, making it easier to debug issues or run with minimal output.
   - Added a global `--log-level`/`-l` argument to the CLI with choices: debug, info, warning, error, critical
   - Centralized logging configuration in the CLI module with a `setup_logging()` function
   - Removed duplicate logging setup in simulation_engine.py
   - Set INFO as the default log level, with DEBUG available for detailed output when needed

7. **Enhanced Job Dependency Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for job dependencies to catch configuration errors early.
   - Created a new validator module with dedicated validation functions
   - Added validation in the `validate` command to check for jobs that extend or need non-existing jobs
   - Added validation in the `simulate` command to check for jobs that need other jobs which won't run in the pipeline
   - Implemented clear error messages that explain the specific dependency issues
   - Added unit tests for the new validation functionality
   - Enhanced to support GitLab CI's complex "needs" format (dictionary with 'job' key) for advanced job dependencies
   - Fixed validation to properly handle template jobs (starting with a dot) to avoid false validation errors
   - Added comprehensive tests for template job validation
   - Changed dependency errors to warnings in the simulate command for better usability
   - Added all expanded jobs with variables substituted to the simulation output for debugging
   - Fixed variable expansion in rules to properly handle variables in conditions and rule variables
   - Fixed a bug where variables in rule conditions were being expanded incorrectly
   - Improved variable expansion in job definitions to correctly handle nested variables
   - Added special handling for regex conditions in rule evaluation
   - Fixed handling of non-existing variables to expand them to empty strings
   - Added comprehensive tests for non-existing variables in various contexts

## Known Issues

Based on the codebase analysis and user testing, remaining issues or limitations include:

1. **Limited Error Handling**: The error handling could be more robust, particularly for edge cases in YAML parsing and job expansion.

2. **Incomplete GitLab CI Feature Support**: Some advanced GitLab CI features may not be fully supported yet.

3. **Limited Validation**: While we've added validation for job dependencies, there are still other aspects of GitLab CI configuration that could benefit from validation against GitLab CI's schema and best practices.

4. **Performance with Large Configurations**: The recursive nature of include resolution and job expansion could lead to performance issues with very large or complex configurations.

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Enhance Documentation**: Create comprehensive user and developer documentation.

2. **Improve Validation**: Implement more detailed validation against GitLab CI's schema and best practices.

3. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more tests, particularly for edge cases and real-world configurations.

4. **Optimize Performance**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks for large configurations.

5. **Add Visualization**: Implement visualization of job dependencies and workflow.
