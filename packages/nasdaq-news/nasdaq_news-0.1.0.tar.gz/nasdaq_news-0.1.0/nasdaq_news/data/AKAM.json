        "text": "Amid a year of catastrophe there are some reasons for optimism. There are tentative signs of good news in terms of the economy and the pandemic; there are more robust signs that there has been a shift in public attitudes about race in America, and a hardening of military attitudes against getting involved in domestic politics. \n These are all to the good. And for those readers who believe President Donald Trump has made many of the country's calamities worse, the additional good news is that he is losing - and losing badly - in his reelection campaign. \n Of course, this being 2020, shorting optimism and going long on pessimism seems like the smart play. There have been wide-ranging debates over the past week about whether 2020 is as bad as 1968 and what else could happen to make things worse. \n As it turns out, I just developed a new course titled \"The End of the World and What Comes After,\" because gaming out worst-case scenarios is so hot right now. So perhaps I can apply what I learned developing that course to puzzle out the current moment. How could this year get even worse? Here are five ways things can go even further south: \n 1) A surge of political violence in the United States. The Black Lives Matter protests have been much more peaceful than similar moments in 1992 or 1968. The police have been considerably more violent. That said, at least the political cleavage created by the protests has been clear and well-defined. \n What concerns me is one of two possibilities. The first is the reappearance of lone-wolf terrorism - a phenomenon that happened during the 2016 cycle and in many ways defined the primary stage of that presidential race. A related concern is what happens if white-nationalist movements start believing the polls (though that is less likely now). What if they realize not only that Trump might lose the...",
