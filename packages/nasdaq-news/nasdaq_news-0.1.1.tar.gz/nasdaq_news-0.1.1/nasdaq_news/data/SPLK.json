Operating Metrics Total Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cTotal ARR\u201d) represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active subscription, term license, and maintenance contracts at the end of a reporting period. Cloud Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cCloud ARR\u201d) represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. Contracts are annualized by dividing the total contract value by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations To supplement Splunk\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Splunk provides investors with the following non-GAAP financial measures: cloud services cost of revenues, cloud services gross margin, cost of revenues, gross margin, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, operating income (loss), operating margin, income tax provision (benefit), net income (loss), net income (loss) per share and free cash flow (collectively the \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): expenses related to stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and facility exit charges, acquisition-related adjustments, capitalized software development costs, a legal settlement charge, non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes, a gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes and a strategic investment impairment. The non-GAAP financial measures are also adjusted for Splunk's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income (loss). To determine the estimated non-GAAP tax rate, Splunk evaluates financial projections based on its non-GAAP results and the tax effect of those projections. The estimated non-GAAP tax rate takes into account many factors including our operating structure and tax positions. The non-GAAP tax rate applied to the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2021 was 20%. The applicable fiscal 2020 tax rates are noted in the reconciliations. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures include free cash flow, which represents operating cash flow less purchases of property and equipment. Splunk considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated or used by the business. Splunk excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Splunk\u2019s operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between Splunk\u2019s operating results and those of other companies. Splunk excludes employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock plans in order for investors to see the full effect that excluding that stock-based compensation expense had on Splunk\u2019s operating results. These expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of Splunk\u2019s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of Splunk\u2019s business. Splunk also excludes amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and facility exit charges, acquisition-related adjustments, capitalized software development costs, a legal settlement charge, non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes, a gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes and a strategic investment impairment from the applicable non-GAAP financial measures because these adjustments are considered by management to be outside of Splunk\u2019s core operating results. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by Splunk\u2019s competitors and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon Splunk\u2019s reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be, for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in Splunk\u2019s business and an important part of the compensation provided to Splunk\u2019s employees. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Splunk uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Splunk believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about Splunk\u2019s operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to competitors\u2019 operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. The following tables reconcile Splunk\u2019s GAAP results to Splunk\u2019s non-GAAP results included in this press release.

Operating Metrics Total Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cTotal ARR\u201d) represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active cloud services, term license and maintenance contracts at the end of a reporting period. Cloud Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cCloud ARR\u201d) represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active cloud services contracts at the end of a reporting period. Each contract is annualized by dividing the contract value by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations To supplement Splunk\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Splunk provides investors with the following non-GAAP financial measures: cloud services cost of revenues, cloud services gross margin, cost of revenues, gross margin, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, operating income (loss), operating margin, income tax provision (benefit), net income (loss), net income (loss) per share and free cash flow (collectively the \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): expenses related to stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax, amortization of intangible assets, adjustments related to facility exits, capitalized software development costs and non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. The non-GAAP financial measures are also adjusted for Splunk's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income (loss). To determine the estimated non-GAAP tax rate, Splunk evaluates financial projections based on its non-GAAP results and the tax effect of those projections. The estimated non-GAAP tax rate takes into account many factors including our operating structure and tax positions. The non-GAAP tax rate applied to the three months ended April 30, 2021 was 20%. The applicable fiscal 2021 tax rates are noted in the reconciliations. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures include free cash flow, which represents operating cash flow less purchases of property and equipment. Splunk considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated or used by the business. Splunk excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Splunk\u2019s operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between Splunk\u2019s operating results and those of other companies. Splunk excludes employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock plans in order for investors to see the full effect that excluding that stock-based compensation expense had on Splunk\u2019s operating results. These expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of Splunk\u2019s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of Splunk\u2019s business. Splunk also excludes amortization of intangible assets, adjustments related to facility exits, capitalized software development costs and non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes from the applicable non-GAAP financial measures because these adjustments are considered by management to be outside of Splunk\u2019s core operating results. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by Splunk\u2019s competitors and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon Splunk\u2019s reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be, for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in Splunk\u2019s business and an important part of the compensation provided to Splunk\u2019s employees. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Splunk uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Splunk believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about Splunk\u2019s operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to competitors\u2019 operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. The following tables reconcile Splunk\u2019s GAAP results to Splunk\u2019s non-GAAP results included in this press release. 2021 2020 $ 70,660 $ 46,044 (853 ) (14,756 ) $ 69,807 $ 31,288 $ 63,751 $ 147,009 $ (60,277 ) $ (47,810 ) $ 88,085 $ (3,670 ) $ (6,741 ) $ - $ (594 ) $ - $ - $ 77,080 54.6 % 1.9 % 3.5 % - % 0.3 % - % - % 60.3 % 171,906 (18,322 ) (10,067 ) - (594 ) - - 142,923 65.8 % 3.6 % 2.0 % - % 0.1 % - % - % 71.5 % 247,198 (80,274 ) (26 ) - 3,067 - - 169,965 356,108 (57,718 ) (4,746 ) - - - - 293,644 162,186 (33,688 ) - (55,234 ) (177 ) - - 73,087 (435,347 ) 190,002 14,839 55,234 (2,296 ) - - (177,568 ) (86.7 )% 37.8 % 3.0 % 11.0 % (0.5 )% - % - % (35.4 )% 1,220 - - - - - (38,309 ) (37,089 ) $ (471,001 ) $ 190,002 $ 14,839 $ 55,234 $ (2,296 ) $ 26,558 $ 38,309 $ (148,355 ) $ (2.89 ) $ 1.17 $ 0.09 $ 0.34 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.16 $ 0.23 $ (0.91 ) $ 53,490 $ (2,390 ) $ (5,006 ) $ - $ - $ - $ 46,094 52.3 % 2.1 % 4.5 % - % - % - % 58.9 % 128,617 (13,982 ) (10,373 ) - - - 104,262 70.4 % 3.2 % 2.4 % - % - % - % 76.0 % 192,124 (71,265 ) (25 ) 3,548 - - 124,382 319,224 (59,422 ) (4,333 ) - - - 255,469 82,724 (21,645 ) - - - - 61,079 (288,612 ) 166,314 14,731 (3,548 ) - - (111,115 ) (66.5 )% 38.3 % 3.4 % (0.8 )% - % - % (25.6 )% (1,669 ) - - - - (20,198 ) (21,867 ) $ (305,579 ) $ 166,314 $ 14,731 $ (3,548 ) $ 20,416 $ 20,198 $ (87,468 ) $ (1.94 ) $ 1.05 $ 0.09 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.13 $ 0.13 $ (0.56 )",
