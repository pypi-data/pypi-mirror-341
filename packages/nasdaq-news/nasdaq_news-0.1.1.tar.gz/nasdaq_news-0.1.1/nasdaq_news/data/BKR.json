        "text": "SEATTLE (AP) - Dan Hughes will not coach the Seattle Storm during the 2020 WNBA season over concerns about his risk for severe illness if he were to contract COVID-19, the team said Monday. \n The decision was made following a medical assessment by the league and in consultation with Hughes' primary care physician. The WNBA is set to begin its season in late July with all teams playing in Florida. \n \"While the Storm family is greatly disappointed that Dan will not be able to join the team this season, his health and family are the top priority. We know he will continue to be an important voice of support for the team and staff while we compete this season,\" Storm CEO and general manager Alisha Valavanis said. \n Hughes, 65, had surgery last year to remove a cancerous tumor from his digestive tract. He missed nine games while recovering. \n Seattle promoted Gary Kloppenburg to head coach for the season. Kloppenburg served as the interim coach last season while Hughes was out. \n \"I am saddened that I won't be able to travel with the team as everyone knows how much love I have for this organization. I am thankful to be in good health and looking forward to supporting Coach Klopp and the staff and players in any way I can this season,\" Hughes said. \n Seattle also promoted Noelle Quinn to associate head coach. Quinn played 12 years in the WNBA and retired after Seattle's league title in 2018. She joined Seattle's coaching staff last year.",

Johnson closed with a 3-under-par 67 for a one-stroke victory over Kevin Streelman at fan-free TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Conn. Johnson last won in Mexico City in March 2019. \u201cI\u2019m definitely proud of myself for continuing the streak, and I want to keep it going,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was a long time between wins, though, and so hopefully it won\u2019t be that long for the next one.\u201d Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus each won in 17 consecutive years. Johnson failed to win in 2014, but is given credit for winning in the 2013-14 season from his victory in the fall of 2013 in Shanghai. The tour changed to a wraparound season in 2013. Johnson tapped in for par on the par-4 18th, then raised his ball to acknowledge the smattering of applause from course workers, officials and reporters \u2014 the only in-person witnesses allowed because of the coronavirus pandemic. He finished at 19-under 261 for his 21st PGA Tour title. Streelman also shot 67. Streelman, who made seven consecutive birdies to win at TPC River Highlands in 2014, had a 37-foot birdie try on 18 that ended up just short and right. He was two strokes behind Johnson on the 17th fairway when the weather horn blew for an hour-long storm delay. Johnson came out of the delay and hit his tee shot on 16 into a greenside bunker. His second shot went well past the hole and he made bogey to cut his lead to a stroke. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few missed cuts, so to come back and finish a solo second is nice, but to to be that close and perform and be right there, I\u2019m just a little disappointed right now,\u201d Streelman said.

Three Months Ended Variance (in millions except per share amounts) June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019 Sequential Year- over-year Orders $ 4,888 $ 5,532 $ 6,554 (12)% (25)% Revenue 4,736 5,425 5,994 (13)% (21)% Operating income (loss) (52) (16,059) 271 F U Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) 104 240 361 (56)% (71)% Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes (201) (10,210) (9) 98% U Adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) attributable to Baker Hughes (31) 70 104 U U EPS attributable to Class A shareholders (0.31) (15.64) (0.02) 98% U Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) attributable to Class A shareholders (0.05) 0.11 0.20 U U Cash flow from operating activities 230 478 593 (52)% (61)% Free cash flow (non-GAAP) 63 152 355 (59)% (82)% \"F\" is used in most instances when variance is above 100%. Additionally, \"U\" is used in most instances when variance is below (100)%. \u201cThe second quarter of 2020 was challenging in several areas as our company navigated through the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the sharp decline in activity levels due to lower oil and gas prices. Despite these headwinds, I was pleased with how our team executed with strong margin performance in TPS and DS, cost execution in OFS, solid order bookings in OFE and TPS, and another quarter of free cash flow generation,\u201d said Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cAlthough the majority of lockdowns have been easing globally and economic activity likely troughed during the second quarter, visibility on the economic outlook remains extremely limited. More specifically, the risk of a second wave of virus cases, the reinstitution of select lockdowns, and the risk of lingering high unemployment creates an uncertain economic environment that likely persists through the rest of 2020. Given these factors, we are preparing for potential future volatility, while also focusing on structurally reducing our cost base and implementing a number of strategic initiatives across all of our product companies. \u201cOverall, we are executing on the framework we laid out on our first quarter earnings call. We are on track to hit our goals of structurally right-sizing our business and achieving the $700 million in annualized cost savings by year end. I am confident in the ability of our team to execute while keeping safety as our highest priority. \u201cWe remain committed to our strategy, maintaining our focus on higher-margin and differentiated portfolio offerings, and providing our customers with leading technologies to support the energy transition,\u201d concluded Simonelli. Quarter Highlights Despite continued market challenges, the Company continued to execute on its priorities in the quarter. Supporting our Customers In the second quarter, the OFS segment delivered 72% of its global drilling services jobs remotely, compared to 60% in the first quarter. Remote wireline jobs increased by 13% compared to the first quarter despite lower activity levels. The OFS team achieved new execution milestones, remotely drilling two miles in a 24-hour period \u2013 an industry first \u2013 and separately drilling 11,253 feet in a 24-hour period with North American customers. OFS\u2019 remote capabilities continue to improve efficiencies and lower costs for customers, with significant projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Middle East, APAC, and Brazil. The OFE segment expanded its remote inspection capabilities in the second quarter, supporting customers facing business continuity issues due to COVID-19 restrictions. OFE\u2019s engageSubsea remote operations offering, a pillar of Subsea Connect, was optimized successfully and deployed across multiple contracts, including equipment installation, factory acceptance testing, and project approvals. In one example, the team installed multiple wellheads on two different rigs, supporting the customer remotely without incurring any downtime. The TPS segment continued to achieve important execution milestones for LNG projects, performing more than 50 remote witness tests and inspections for customers in the second quarter. In June, TPS announced the completion of the First Engine to Test (FETT) for the LM9000 aeroderivative gas turbine for NOVATEK\u2019s Arctic LNG 2 project. The FETT completion paves the way for the supply of the LM9000 for NOVATEK\u2019s new LNG projects and confirms the LM9000 as the world\u2019s most efficient and powerful aeroderivative gas turbine in its class, with simple-cycle efficiency in excess of 44% and power output 15% higher compared to industry peers. This efficiency is key to driving lower carbon intensity and, combined with lower NOx emissions (15 ppm in dry condition, 40% lower than competing technology), is a more environmentally sensitive solution. TPS also won a contract to supply nine NovaLT16 gas turbines for a utility power generation project in the Middle East. The NovaLT family provides a more-efficient, cleaner power generation solution for a broad range of industrial and emerging energy applications, with the customer awarding the contract based on the NovaLT\u2019s superior performance in electrical efficiency (36% at ISO conditions) and plant availability (35,000 hours mean time between maintenance). The DS segment maintained critical customer support in key international markets such as China, where customers began to resume normal operations after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. DS also continued to drive growth across industrial end markets, winning key contracts with multiple automotive OEMs for industrial X-Ray and CT systems in Asia and Europe. Executing on Priorities OFS continued to focus on its differentiated portfolio to help customers lower costs and increase efficiencies, securing multi-year contracts for drilling services, completions, and artificial lift. The OFS Chemicals product line won multiple large orders in North America, APAC, and Sub-Saharan Africa, including securing a five-year preferred partnership agreement with Marathon Petroleum Corporation to provide downstream hydrocarbon treatment products and services at its 16 refining locations. TPS continued to execute against its strategic priorities, including growth in services and upgrades. In the second quarter, TPS secured a key upgrades contract for an onshore project in Algeria. The upgrades will enhance the plant\u2019s gas treatment and compressor trains, increasing production and efficiency of the plant while eliminating gas flaring. The project scope includes engineering, supply of equipment, site modifications, and commissioning. In DS, the Bently Nevada product line continued to drive growth across industrial segments. In the second quarter, Bently Nevada executed a major project in South America to provide a plant-wide condition monitoring solution for the Arauco pulp & paper plant in Chile, one of the largest plants of its kind in the world. Leading with Innovation Baker Hughes continued to drive advancements in leading technologies and being at the forefront of the energy transition. As customers look for more productive and efficient operations, the BakerHughesC3.ai joint venture alliance secured a contract with a Canadian oil company to deploy BHC3\u2122 Production Optimization, an AI-based application that helps operators better visualize and optimize oil and gas production. The contract marks the first customer commitment for Production Optimization since the technology was announced at Baker Hughes\u2019 Annual Meeting in the first quarter. The Company remains committed to reducing its carbon footprint as well as those of its customers. In the second quarter, TPS successfully completed a testing campaign to replace conventional refrigerant gases for compressor testing at its largest global rotating machinery testing facility in Massa, Italy. The new hydrofluoro-olefin gas will enable the Company to save an average of 20,000 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per year for the Massa and Florence TPS sites combined. OFS significantly expanded the capabilities of its i-Trak automation service. Eight out of nine Equinor rigs in Norway are now using this service to identify well incidents early, resulting in reduced risk of stuck pipe, lost circulation, and other well events. As a first-of-its kind automated directional drilling service, i-Trak provides more efficient drilling at a lower cost for the operator.
