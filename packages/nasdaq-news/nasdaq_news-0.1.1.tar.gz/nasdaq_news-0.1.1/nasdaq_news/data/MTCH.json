(\u201cMatch\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: MTCH) common stock between November 3, 2021 and January 31, 2023, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Match investors have until May 5, 2023 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors suffering losses on their Match investments are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 888-638-4847 or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com. On August 2, 2022, Match released its second quarter 2022 financial results, warning that it expected the growth of its largest and most important brand, Tinder, to slow in the second half of 2022 as the result of poor product execution, admitting that \u201cTinder did not deliver on its product roadmap for the first half of the year,\u201d forcing the Company to delay the launch of several initiatives and optimizations. On this news, Match\u2019s stock price fell $13.47, or 17.6%, to close at $63.24 per share on August 3, 2022, thereby injuring investors. Then, on January 31, 2023, Match reported disappointing financial results for 2022, including total revenue that missed the Company\u2019s prior guidance. The Company attributed the shortfall to \u201cweaker-than-expected product execution at Tinder, the effects of which became more pronounced as the year progressed.\u201d On this news, Match\u2019s stock price fell $2.72, or 5%, to close at $51.41 per share on February 1, 2023, thereby injuring investors further. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company was not effectively executing on Tinder\u2019s new product initiatives; (2) as a result, the Company was not on track to deliver Tinder\u2019s planned product initiatives in 2022; and (3) as a result, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased Match common stock, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Howard G. Smith, Esquire, of Law Offices of Howard G. Smith, 3070 Bristol Pike, Suite 112, Bensalem, Pennsylvania 19020, by telephone at (215) 638-4847, toll-free at (888) 638-4847, or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com, or visit our website at www.howardsmithlaw.com.

(MTCH) Failed to Disclose it Would be Unable to Deliver Tinder's Planned Product Initiatives According to the complaint, on November 3, 2021, in a letter to shareholders, defendants touted Tinder\u2019s \u201cradical product transformation,\u201d which included recently launched product initiatives such as a new \u201cExplore\u201d feature. Defendants further stated that \u201c[t]he interactive and social experiences within Explore are the harbinger for Tinder\u2019s long-term vision,\u201d and noted that Tinder was working on several other monetization opportunities, such as an in-app virtual currency. Defendants continued to represent that Tinder was effectively executing on several critical product initiatives that would drive growth for the Company in 2022 and beyond. On August 2, 2022, the Company announced financial results for the second quarter of 2022 and warned that it expected Tinder\u2019s growth to slow in the second half of 2022 as the result of poor product execution. Specifically, defendants admitted that \u201cTinder did not deliver on its product roadmap for the first half of the year,\u201d forcing he Company to delay the launch of several initiatives and optimizations that it had previously expected to generate growth in 2022. On this news, the price of Match common stock declined $13.47 per share, or more than 17%, from a close of $76.71 per share on August 2, 2022, to close at $63.24 per share on August 3, 2022. On January 31, 2023, the Company again reported disappointing financial results for 2022, including total revenue that missed the Company\u2019s prior guidance. Defendants largely attributed the shortfall to \u201cweaker-than-expected product execution at Tinder, the effects of which became more pronounced as the year progressed.\u201d During an earnings conference call the following day, defendants further admitted that Tinder had \u201cdecelerated as the year went on.\u201d On this news, the price of Match common stock declined $2.71 per share, or 5%, from a close of $54.12 per share on January 31, 2023, to close at $51.41 per share on February 1, 2023.

(NASDAQ: MTCH) (\u201cMatch\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company\u2019s common stock between November 3, 2021 and January 31, 2023, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Match is a technology and social media company that operates one of the world\u2019s largest portfolios of online dating brands and apps. Tinder, which generated more than half of Match\u2019s revenue during the Class Period, is Match\u2019s largest and most important brand. According to the complaint, throughout the Class Period Match Group and certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers falsely represented to investors that Tinder was effectively executing on several critical product initiatives that would drive growth for the Company in 2022 and beyond. However, investors began to learn the truth on August 2, 2022, when the Company announced financial results for the second quarter of 2022 and warned that it expected Tinder\u2019s growth to slow in the second half of 2022 as the result of poor product execution. Following this disclosure, shares of Match common stock declined $13.47 per share, or more than 17% in value, to close at $63.24 per share on August 3, 2022, on heavy trading volume. Then, on January 31, 2023, Match reported disappointing financial results for 2022, including total revenue that missed the Company\u2019s prior guidance. Notably, defendants largely attributed the shortfall to \u201cweaker-than-expected product execution at Tinder, the effects of which became more pronounced as the year progressed.\u201d Following this disclosure, the price of Match common stock declined an additional $2.71 per share, or 5% in value, to close at $51.41 per share on February 1, 2023, again on heavy trading volume. Investors who purchased Match common stock during the Class Period and suffered an investment loss in excess of $100,000 are encouraged to immediately contact Kaskela Law LLC (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (484) 229 \u2013 0750, or by email (skaskela@kaskelalaw.com / abell@kaskelalaw.com) or online at https://kaskelalaw.com/cases/stock-fraud-match-group/ , for additional information about this action and their legal rights and recovery options. IMPORTANT DEADLINE: Investors who purchased Match common stock during the Class Period and suffered a financial loss may, no later than May 5, 2023, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative in the action through Kaskela Law LLC or other counsel.
