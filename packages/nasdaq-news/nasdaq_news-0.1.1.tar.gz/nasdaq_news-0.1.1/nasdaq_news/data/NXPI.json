        "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For years, technologists have been talking about smarter cars packed with sensors, chips and supercomputers that can replace human drivers.That was enough to get investors excited about the future of automotive semiconductors. An earnings report from NXP Semiconductors NV late Monday\u00a0reminds us of one slight flaw in the plan: People need to actually buy cars.The Dutch company said revenue will drop approximately 20% this quarter to around $1.8 billion. The figure is in line with estimates that analysts slashed by 23% over the past eight weeks.\u00a0NXP cut its first-quarter revenue estimate at the start of March, only to fall short of that mark. The company forecast a second-quarter operating loss of as much as $237 million, versus an estimated deficit of $169 million.So far this year, much of the attention in semiconductors has been on whether smartphones are a necessity \u2014\u00a0 Xiaomi Corp. thinks so,\u00a0I disagree \u2014\u00a0and whether work-from-home and streaming demand will drive server sales enough to\u00a0make up for the drop in consumer spending. The outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. suggests otherwise.NXP, however, is playing in a different arena: It\u00a0got 47% of its revenue from automotive clients last year. The company said Monday that it was \u201cnavigating a challenging and very fluid environment.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s an understatement. After a 4.5% decline in global automobile\u00a0shipments in 2018 and a 3.9% drop last year, hopes that the industry might avoid a third year of contraction are out the window as the\u00a0Covid-19 pandemic hits demand and supply.NXP isn\u2019t alone. Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies AG gets 43% of its revenue from the auto sector. This month, the company\u00a0completed its $9.3 billion(1) acquisition of California\u2019s Cypress Semiconductor Corp.\u00a0You\u2019ll never guess which sector accounts for 39% of that company\u2019s business.\u00a0Forgive Infineon shareholders if they start to feel that the 47% premium they paid for Cypress might be a little steep. Ironically, shareholders seem to be forgiving management, with the stock rebounding from a mid-March low to be 30% off its February peak, and back to where it was in early October.Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anand Srinivasan has been ahead of the curve. He predicted\u00a0two weeks ago that the then-consensus estimate for a 4% decline in NXP revenue this year was conservative, and that 6% might be more realistic.\u00a0Today, data on the Bloomberg terminal points to a 10% drop, the worst since the financial crisis in 2009.At Infineon, analysts are looking at a 7% drop in sales for the year ending Sept.\u00a030. That may also be conservative.Xiaomi may believe that smartphones are a must-have, and Apple Inc. certainly hopes that its new iPhone SE will find favor\u00a0even among tight-fisted consumers. But with a global recession on the way, you\u2019d have to be Elon Musk to believe that the auto sector, and the chipmakers\u00a0that supply them, are going to survive with only minor bruising.(1) Equity plus debt in an all-cash dealThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Analysts had predicted $1.82 billion, the average of estimates made in the last 28 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A year earlier, the company reported sales of $2.2 billion.The operating loss will be $115 million to $237 million.Shares, which closed at $97.13 in New York, initially slipped and then rose about 3% following the report.Key InsightsNXP cut its first-quarter sales forecast in early March, only to miss analyst forecasts later when it reported preliminary sales for the period. Earlier this month, it said demand outside China had started to \u201csignificantly deteriorate.\u201dNXP\u2019s industrial and mobile industry clients are also pushing back orders in response to weakening demand from their customers, the company said.\u201cNXP\u2019s rising-star-rating momentum is now likely to fade,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Robert Schiffman wrote last week, while adding that the company\u2019s credit ratings are unlikely to be at risk in the near term.Market ContextNXP shares have fallen by around 24% so far this year, compared to a 7.9% decline by a broader index of European semiconductor stocks. That underperformance is driven partly by its strong exposure to the auto industry.Get MoreFirst-quarter revenue fell 3% to $2.02 billion, the Eindhoven, Netherlands-based semiconductor supplier said on Monday. That was in line with a preliminary company estimate published on April 7.Operating income was $68 million in the period.Revenue at its largest unit, chips used in vehicles, was $994 million, down 4% from a year earlier.See more of the results here.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",
