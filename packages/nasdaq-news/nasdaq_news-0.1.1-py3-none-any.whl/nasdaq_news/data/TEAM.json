        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ: TEAM), a leading provider of team collaboration and productivity software, today announced preliminary financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2021 ended March 31, 2021. Atlassian also announced that it will release full financial results on Thursday, April 29, 2021 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and its financial outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 ending on June 30, 2021. \u201cAtlassian is a long-term focused company and we operate with a culture of openness,\u201d said Scott Farquhar, Atlassian\u2019s co-founder and co-CEO. \u201cConsistent with these principles, today we are publicly sharing strong preliminary revenue results for our third quarter which were driven by short-term dynamics related to our server and data center products. Our goal is to separate out this discrete impact from our long-term focus of delivering innovation and customer value. We look forward to sharing more about how we\u2019re unleashing the potential of every team and building the future of modern work at Team \u201921 and during our April 29, 2021 quarterly conference call.\u201d Preliminary Financial Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021 Revenue: Total revenue in the approximate range of $566 million to $572 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. This preliminary result is approximately $85 million above the midpoint of revenue guidance provided during the Q2\u201921 financial results announcement on January 28, 2021. As discussed in prior shareholder letters, Atlassian expects to see heightened short-term revenue variability given its focus on accelerating customer migration from its server products to its cloud and data center products. Third-quarter revenue outperformance was primarily driven by accelerated short-term demand for on-premises products as a result of customers purchasing ahead of both the discontinuation of new server license sales and price changes to on-premises products during the quarter. Atlassian believes this heightened demand strength is short-term \u2018event-driven\u2019 in nature as both the discontinuation of new server license sales and on-premises product price increases became effective in Q3\u201921. Specific to reported revenue lines: server license sales, reported in perpetual license revenue, represented approximately 25% of the revenue outperformance while server maintenance revenue represented approximately 15% of the outperformance; data center revenue, reported in subscription revenue, represented approximately 25% of outperformance; and marketplace revenue, reported in other revenue, represented approximately 35% of the outperformance. Third-quarter cloud revenue grew in-line with the company\u2019s prior mid-30% subscription growth target for fiscal year 2021. No cloud price changes were enacted in Q3\u201921. For reference, server maintenance and cloud revenue are both recognized ratably over the term of the contract, while server perpetual license sales generate revenue once the customer obtains control of the license. For data center revenue, the portion that relates to the delivery of the term license is recognized in subscription revenue in the period that contract is signed, while the remainder is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Third-party marketplace apps revenue is recognized in the period the product is purchased. Profitability: Operating margin on an IFRS and non-IFRS basis for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 is expected to outperform the guidance provided on January 28, 2021. This is the direct result of short-term on-premises revenue outperformance. Free cash flow is also expected to show a significant short-term increase given heightened on-premises product demand during the quarter. Atlassian does not expect this heightened level of profitability to continue at the same rate into future quarters. Atlassian\u2019s focus will be on consistently executing against its long-term investment roadmap to gain scale in its large technical and non-technical end markets and deliver customers a best-in-class cloud experience. Atlassian continues to make steady progress against the current fiscal year\u2019s ambitious hiring and investment roadmap and plans to build upon that momentum through the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond.
