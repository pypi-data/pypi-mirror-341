        "text": "CAMPBELL, Kalifornien, USA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Der Innovator der digitalen Fertigung, VELO3D, und die Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) haben heute eine gemeinsame Entwicklungsvereinbarung \u00fcber die Zusammenarbeit bei neuartigen Materialien und Designs im Bereich der additiven Metallfertigung (AM) und 3D-Druckanwendungen f\u00fcr die Halbleiterindustrie bekannt gegeben. Lam plant, das Volumen der im AM-Verfahren produzierten Teile in den n\u00e4chsten f\u00fcnf Jahren deutlich zu erh\u00f6hen. Die additive Fertigung erlaubt die Transformation der Lieferkette von subtraktiven Herstellungsverfahren hin zu leistungsf\u00e4higeren, innovativen Designs, die agilen Lieferketten die \u00dcbernahme von Industrie-4.0-Prinzipien erm\u00f6glicht. VELO3D wird auf seinem Drucker Sapphire\u00ae neue Metalllegierungen entwickeln, die f\u00fcr Lam-Designs und -Technologien erforderlich sind. Lam Capital wird zudem einen unver\u00f6ffentlichten Betrag in VELO3D investieren. \u201eLam Research nutzt die additive Fertigung zur F\u00f6rderung von Innovationen und erm\u00f6glicht so unseren Kunden, kleinere, schnellere, leistungsst\u00e4rkere und energieeffizientere elektronische Ger\u00e4te f\u00fcr den t\u00e4glichen Gebrauch zu entwickeln\u201c, so Kevin Jennings, Senior Vice President of Global Operations bei Lam Research. \u201eDiese gemeinsame Entwicklungsvereinbarung unterst\u00fctzt Lam\u2018s Ziel, kontinuierlich nach neuen Technologien zu suchen, die die Grenzen von Produktdesign und Herstellung erweitern. Wir freuen uns, als f\u00fchrendes Unternehmen der Halbleiterindustrie unseren Kunden die Vorteile der additiven Metallfertigung anbieten zu k\u00f6nnen.\u201c \u201eDie Halbleiterproduktion ist eines der besten Beispiele f\u00fcr Massenfertigung, und Lam verlangt die bestm\u00f6gliche Wiederholbarkeit und Konsistenz, um eine Pr\u00e4zision im atomaren Ma\u00dfstab zu erreichen\u201c, erkl\u00e4rt Benny Buller, CEO und Gr\u00fcnder von VELO3D. \u201eDank unserer F\u00e4higkeiten bei Kalibrierung, Messtechnik und digitaler R\u00fcckverfolgbarkeit ist VELO 3D gut positioniert, um Vertrauen in das 3D-Metalldruckverfahren zu schaffen. Diese Partnerschaft zielt darauf ab, den Weg von Lam der kontinuierlichen Innovation bei der Herstellung von Produktionsanlagen f\u00fcr modernste Mikroprozessoren, Speicherger\u00e4te und zahlreiche verwandte Produkttypen zu beschleunigen.\u201c Die additive Metallfertigung ist eine vielversprechende Komponente der digitalen Transformation, die den Einsatz analoger Fertigungsmethoden reduziert. Nach Vorgabe einer CAD-Datei werden Produktionsteile aus Metall im AM-Verfahren mithilfe von Lasern hergestellt, indem feines Metallpulver Schicht f\u00fcr Schicht verschmolzen wird. Der 3D-Druck verk\u00fcrzt die Fertigungszeiten, reduziert den Bedarf an Rohmaterial und erm\u00f6glicht komplexere Bauweisen, die mit herk\u00f6mmlichen Methoden schwierig oder nur sehr kostspielig realisiert werden k\u00f6nnen. VELO3D hat k\u00fcrzlich eine Finanzierungsrunde von 40 Mio. USD abgeschlossen, wodurch sich die Gesamtfinanzierung des Unternehmen auf 150 Mio. USD erh\u00f6ht. Diese neue Investition erlaubt dem Unternehmen, seine technologischen F\u00e4higkeiten weiter auszubauen und bis Mitte 2022 die Gewinnzone zu erreichen. Lam Capital ist die Risikokapitalgruppe von Lam Research und investiert in innovative Unternehmen, die sich den anspruchsvollsten und bedeutendsten Herausforderungen der heutigen Zeit stellen. Von innovativen Halbleiter- und Produktionstechnologien bis hin zu KI- und Industrie-4.0-Technologien investiert Lam Capital in Start-ups, die disruptive L\u00f6sungen entwickeln, und schlie\u00dft Partnerschaften mit ihnen.

Esta relaci\u00f3n tiene como objetivo acelerar el proceso de Lam en la innovaci\u00f3n continua para la producci\u00f3n de equipos que creen microprocesadores, dispositivos de memoria y una gran variedad de productos relacionados de vanguardia\u201d. La FA de metales es un componente prometedor en el movimiento de transformaci\u00f3n digital que logra disminuir la dependencia en metodolog\u00edas de fabricaci\u00f3n anal\u00f3gicas. A partir de un archivo CAD, la FA crea piezas met\u00e1licas de producci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del uso de l\u00e1ser que fusiona un polvo fino de metal, capa por capa. La impresi\u00f3n 3D permite acelerar los plazos, reducir el uso de materia prima y de dise\u00f1os complejos demasiado dif\u00edciles o costosos de fabricar con los m\u00e9todos convencionales. Recientemente, VELO3D cerr\u00f3 una ronda de financiamiento de 40 millones de d\u00f3lares, tras lo cual alcanz\u00f3 un financiamiento total de 150 millones para la empresa. Esta nueva inversi\u00f3n permite a la empresa ampliar sus capacidades tecnol\u00f3gicas y alcanzar la rentabilidad para mediados de 2022.
