(\u201cAEP\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (NYSE: AEP) for violations of \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors who purchased the Company's securities between November 2, 2016 and July 24, 2020, inclusive (the ''Class Period''), are encouraged to contact the firm before October 19, 2020. If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate. We also encourage you to contact Brian Schall of the Schall Law Firm, 1880 Century Park East, Suite 404, Los Angeles, CA 90067, at 310-301-3335, to discuss your rights free of charge. You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com, or by email at brian@schallfirm.com. The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. AEP engaged in a scheme described as \u201cthe largest public corruption case in Ohio history.\u201d The Company covertly funded political organizations to bribe politicians to pass Ohio House Bill 6, to the Company\u2019s benefit. The Company also engaged in a misleading advertising campaign related to the bill. The Company improperly subverted a citizen\u2019s ballot to repeal HB6. Despite claiming to protect its customers\u2019 interests, the Company sought a state-mandated surcharge on their bills. Based on these facts, the Company\u2019s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about AEP, investors suffered damages.
