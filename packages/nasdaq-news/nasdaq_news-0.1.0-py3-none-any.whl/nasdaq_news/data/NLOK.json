        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NortonLifeLock Inc. (NASDAQ: NLOK), a global leader in consumer Cyber Safety, today reported results for its fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 which ended April 3, 2020. Fourth Quarter GAAP Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations Revenue was $614 million, compared to $617 million a year ago GAAP diluted EPS was $0.23, compared to $0.06 a year ago Fourth Quarter Operational and Non-GAAP Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations Consumer revenue was $610 million, up 1% year-over-year in constant currency Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.26, compared to $0.16 a year ago, up 63% year-over-year Consumer reported billings growth of 3% year-over-year Average revenue per user of $9.07, up 3% year-over-year \u201cIn only our second quarter as NortonLifeLock, we drove better than expected results on both the top and bottom lines as we turned our focus to driving sustainable growth. With consumer bookings up 4% year-over-year and another quarter of sequential customer growth, consumers are seeing the value we provide in protecting their digital lives as they live more and more online,\u201d said Vincent Pilette, CEO of NortonLifeLock. \u201cI am extremely proud of how we supported our customers during this COVID-19 crisis and how we are laying the foundation for long term growth.\u201d Transition to a Pure-Play Consumer Company Nearly Complete NortonLifeLock\u2019s transition to a pure-play consumer company continued at a fast pace with over 70% of stranded cost removal completed within five months. Total stranded costs eliminated through the transition is estimated to be less than $1 billion, of which $750 million are cash costs. The cash costs are more than offset by an estimated $1.5 billion of cash inflow from sales of underutilized assets, half of which has already been realized. Returned $9 Billion to Investors and Ending Cash Balance of $2.3 Billion NortonLifeLock returned $9 billion to investors during the quarter, including the special dividend, regular dividend, share repurchase, and convertible note retirement. With $2.3 billon of cash and no debt maturities until the end of our fiscal year 2022, the company is well positioned to invest in expanding its portfolio to serve the cyber safety needs of everyone. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Guidance Revenue in the range of $590 to $605 million, 0 to 2% growth adjusting for extra week ($44 million) and ID Analytics revenue ($14 million) in first quarter fiscal year 2020 Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 NortonLifeLock\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on June 24, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 10, 2020. To help readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures.

(2) In the three months ended April 3, 2020, we divested our ID Analytics solutions and are presenting consumer reported billings and consumer revenues to enhance comparability of the reported billings and revenues of our remaining solutions to the year ago period. (3) Calculated using year ago foreign exchange rates. (4) Other contract liabilities adjustment for the year ended April 3, 2020 represents the change in contract liabilities related to Veritas discontinued operations of $5 million. Other contract liabilities adjustment for the three months and the year ended March 29, 2019 represents the change in contract liabilities related to Veritas discontinued operations of $2 million and $19 million, respectively. In addition, other contract liabilities adjustment for the year ended March 29, 2019 includes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard of $17 million. (5) ARPU in the year ended April 3, 2020 was normalized to exclude the impact of the extra week on direct revenue, which we estimate to be approximately $41 million. NORTONLIFELOCK INC. Appendix A Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Items Objective of non-GAAP measures: We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company\u2019s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing NortonLifeLock\u2019s performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. Due to the importance of these measures in managing the business, we use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of management\u2019s compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Contract liabilities adjustment: Our non-GAAP net revenues eliminate the impact of contract liabilities purchase accounting adjustments required by GAAP. GAAP requires an adjustment to the liability for acquired contract liabilities such that the liability approximates how much we, the acquirer, would have to pay a third party to assume the liability. We believe that eliminating the impact of this adjustment improves the comparability of revenues between periods. Also, although the adjustment amounts will never be recognized in our GAAP financial statements, we do not expect the acquisitions to affect the future renewal rates of revenues excluded by the adjustments. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP net revenues, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting adjustments to assess our operating performance and overall revenue trends. Nevertheless, non-GAAP net revenues has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net revenues. We believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends of our business. However, other companies in our industry may not calculate these measures in the same manner which may limit their usefulness for comparative purposes. Stock-based compensation: This consists of expenses for employee restricted stock units, performance-based awards, bonus share programs, stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, determined in accordance with GAAP. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size, nature and design of the awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors that are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of the market value of our common stock. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation to facilitate the comparison of our results to those of other companies in our industry. Amortization of intangible assets: Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges relating to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of revenues and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Under purchase accounting, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. However, the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur to internally develop the intangible asset. Further, amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We eliminate these charges from our non-GAAP operating results to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and provide better comparability to our past operating performance. Restructuring, transition and other costs: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, contract termination costs, and assets write-offs, as well as other exit and disposal costs. Included in other exit and disposal costs are advisory fees incurred in connection with restructuring events and facilities exit costs. Separation costs primarily consist of consulting costs incurred in connection with the divestiture of our Enterprise Security business (the Broadcom sale). Transition costs are associated with formal discrete strategic information technology initiatives and primarily consist of consulting charges associated with our enterprise resource planning and supporting systems and costs to automate business processes. We exclude restructuring, transition and other costs from our non-GAAP results as we believe that these costs are incremental to core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and do not reflect our current operating performance, and that excluding these charges facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Acquisition-related costs: These represent the transaction and business integration costs related to significant acquisitions that are charged to operating expense in our GAAP financial statements. These costs include incremental expenses incurred to affect these business combinations such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. We exclude these costs from our non-GAAP results as they have no direct correlation to the operation of our business, and because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding these costs provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the spending trends of our business. In addition, these costs vary, depending on the size and complexity of the acquisitions, and are not indicative of costs of future acquisitions. Litigation settlement: We may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. We exclude these charges and benefits when associated with a significant settlement because we do not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs: In accordance with GAAP, we separately account for the value of the conversion feature on our convertible notes as a debt discount that reflects our assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rates. We amortize the discount and debt issuance costs over the term of the related debt. We exclude the difference between the imputed interest expense, which includes the amortization of the conversion feature and of the issuance costs, and the coupon interest payments because we believe that excluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the cash cost of our convertible debt and enhance investors\u2019 ability to view the Company\u2019s results from management\u2019s perspective. Gains on divestiture and sale of equity method investment: We periodically recognize gains on divestitures. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized a gain of $379 million related to the sale of our DigiCert equity interest. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized a gain of $250 million related to the divestiture of our ID Analytics solutions. We have excluded these gains for purposes of calculating our non-GAAP results. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Gain (loss) from equity interest: We record gains or losses in equity method investments representing net income or loss attributable to our noncontrolling interest in companies over which we have limited control and visibility. We exclude such gains and losses in full because we lack control over the operations of the investee and the related gains and losses are not indicative of our ongoing core results. Income tax effects and adjustments: We use a non-GAAP tax rate that excludes (1) the discrete impacts of changes in tax legislation, (2) most other significant discrete items, (3) certain unique GAAP reporting requirements under discontinued operations and (4) the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustment to our operating results described above. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Our tax rate is subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix due to acquisition and divestiture activities or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate. In June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which reversed a United States Tax Court decision regarding the treatment of share-based compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement. As a result, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $23 million for continuing operation in fiscal 2020, which has been excluded from our non-GAAP tax provision. For fiscal 2019, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we used a non-GAAP tax rate that excluded (1) the discrete impacts of changes in tax legislation, (2) most other significant discrete items, (3) certain unique GAAP reporting requirements under discontinued operations and (4) the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustment to our operating results described above. Discontinued operations: On November 4, 2019, we completed the Broadcom sale. In January 2016, we completed the sale of assets related to our Veritas operations. The results of our divested operations that were subject to these divestitures are presented as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and thus have been excluded from non-GAAP net income for all reported periods. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding: Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss from continuing operations. In accordance with GAAP, we do not present dilution for GAAP in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations. However, if there is non-GAAP net income, we present dilution for non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in an amount equal to the dilution that would have been presented had there been GAAP income from continuing operations for the period. Reported billings: We define reported billings as total revenue plus the change in adjusted contract liabilities. The change in contract liabilities excludes the change related to discontinued operations that does not amortize to revenue from continuing operations. We consider reported billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because it facilitates an analysis of changes in contract liabilities balances that are an indicator of the health and visibility of our business. There are several limitations related to the use of reported billings versus revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, reported billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Second, our calculation of reported billings may be different from other companies in our industry, some of which may not use reported billings, may calculate reported billings differently, may have different reported billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of reported billings as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating reported billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consumer reported billings: We define consumer reported billings as total revenue plus the change in adjusted contract liabilities excluding amounts related to our ID Analytics solutions. ID Analytics solutions were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We are presenting consumer reported billings to provide readers with a better understanding of the impact from the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions on the historical performance of our consumer business and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods. This metric is subject to the same limitations as reported billings discussed above. Bookings: Bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future. We present the operational metric of bookings because it reflects customers' demand for our products and services and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods. Free cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and thus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues: Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues are defined as revenues adjusted for foreign exchange impact, calculated by translating current period revenue using the year ago currency conversion rate. Consumer revenues: Consumer revenues exclude revenues from our ID Analytics solutions, which was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We are presenting consumer revenues to provide readers with a better understanding of the impact from the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions on our historical results and to assist readers in analyzing results in future periods. Consumer Cyber Safety direct customer count: Direct customers are defined as those customers of our Consumer Cyber Safety solutions who have a direct billing relationship with us, including online acquisition and retention, affiliates, co-marketing, and original equipment manufacturer channels. Also excluded are customers of our ID Analytics solutions. Average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the fiscal quarter. Consumer Cyber Safety direct average revenues per user (ARPU): ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base. Annual retention rate: Annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a one-year tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago. We monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.",

Through Q1, approximately 95% of the stranded costs have been removed and the latest estimate for total stranded costs are $950 million, of which $650 million are cash costs. The stranded cash costs have already been more than offset by $875 million in realized proceeds from the sale of under-utilized assets. The Company remains committed to its target of $1.5 billion in total proceeds from sales of under-utilized assets.

Appendix A Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Items Objective of non-GAAP measures: We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company\u2019s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing NortonLifeLock\u2019s performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. Due to the importance of these measures in managing the business, we use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of management\u2019s compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Contract liabilities adjustment: Our non-GAAP net revenues eliminate the impact of contract liabilities purchase accounting adjustments required by GAAP. GAAP requires an adjustment to the liability for acquired contract liabilities such that the liability approximates how much we, the acquirer, would have to pay a third party to assume the liability. We believe that eliminating the impact of this adjustment improves the comparability of revenues between periods. Also, although the adjustment amounts will never be recognized in our GAAP financial statements, we do not expect the acquisitions to affect the future renewal rates of revenues excluded by the adjustments. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP net revenues, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting adjustments to assess our operating performance and overall revenue trends. Nevertheless, non-GAAP net revenues has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net revenues. We believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends of our business. However, other companies in our industry may not calculate these measures in the same manner which may limit their usefulness for comparative purposes. Stock-based compensation: This consists of expenses for employee restricted stock units, performance-based awards, bonus share programs, stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, determined in accordance with GAAP. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size, nature and design of the awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors that are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of the market value of our common stock. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation to facilitate the comparison of our results to those of other companies in our industry. Amortization of intangible assets: Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges relating to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of revenues and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Under purchase accounting, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. However, the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur to internally develop the intangible asset. Further, amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We eliminate these charges from our non-GAAP operating results to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and provide better comparability to our past operating performance. Restructuring and other costs: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, contract termination costs, and assets write-offs, as well as other exit and disposal costs. Included in other exit and disposal costs are advisory fees incurred in connection with restructuring events and facilities exit costs. Separation costs primarily consist of consulting costs incurred in connection with the divestiture of our Enterprise Security business (the Broadcom sale). We exclude restructuring and other costs from our non-GAAP results as we believe that these costs are incremental to core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and do not reflect our current operating performance, and that excluding these charges facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Acquisition-related costs: These represent the transaction and business integration costs related to significant acquisitions that are charged to operating expense in our GAAP financial statements. These costs include incremental expenses incurred to affect these business combinations such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. We exclude these costs from our non-GAAP results as they have no direct correlation to the operation of our business, and because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding these costs provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the spending trends of our business. In addition, these costs vary, depending on the size and complexity of the acquisitions, and are not indicative of costs of future acquisitions. Litigation settlement: We may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. We exclude these charges and benefits when associated with a significant settlement because we do not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs: In accordance with GAAP, we separately account for the value of the conversion feature on our convertible notes as a debt discount that reflects our assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rates. We amortize the discount and debt issuance costs over the term of the related debt. We exclude the difference between the imputed interest expense, which includes the amortization of the conversion feature and of the issuance costs, and the coupon interest payments because we believe that excluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the cash cost of our convertible debt and enhance investors\u2019 ability to view the Company\u2019s results from management\u2019s perspective. Gains on divestiture and sale of equity method investment: We periodically recognize gains on divestitures. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized a gain of $379 million related to the sale of our DigiCert equity interest. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized a gain of $250 million related to the divestiture of our ID Analytics solutions. We have excluded these gains for purposes of calculating our non-GAAP results. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt: We record gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. Gains or losses represent the difference between the fair value of the exchange consideration and the carrying value of the liability component of the debt at the date of extinguishment. We exclude the gain or loss on debt extinguishment in our non-GAAP results because they are not reflective of our ongoing business. Gain (loss) from equity method investment: We record gains or losses in equity method investments representing net income or loss attributable to our noncontrolling interest in companies over which we have limited control and visibility. We exclude such gains and losses in full because we lack control over the operations of the investee and the related gains and losses are not indicative of our ongoing core results. Gain (loss) on equity investments: We record gains or losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments in privately-held companies. We exclude the net gains or losses because we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business. Income tax effects and adjustments: We use a non-GAAP tax rate that excludes (1) the discrete impacts of changes in tax legislation, (2) most other significant discrete items, (3) certain unique GAAP reporting requirements under discontinued operations and (4) the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustment to our operating results described above. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Our tax rate is subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix due to acquisition and divestiture activities or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate. In June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which reversed a United States Tax Court decision regarding the treatment of share-based compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement. As a result, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $23 million for continuing operation in fiscal 2020, which has been excluded from our non-GAAP tax provision. Discontinued operations: On November 4, 2019, we completed the Broadcom sale. In January 2016, we completed the sale of assets related to our Veritas operations. The results of our divested operations that were subject to these divestitures are presented as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and thus have been excluded from non-GAAP net income for all reported periods. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding: Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss from continuing operations. In accordance with GAAP, we do not present dilution for GAAP in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations. However, if there is non-GAAP net income, we present dilution for non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in an amount equal to the dilution that would have been presented had there been GAAP income from continuing operations for the period. Reported billings: We define reported billings as total revenue plus the change in adjusted contract liabilities. The change in contract liabilities excludes the change related to discontinued operations that does not amortize to revenue from continuing operations. We consider reported billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because it facilitates an analysis of changes in contract liabilities balances that are an indicator of the health and visibility of our business. There are several limitations related to the use of reported billings versus revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, reported billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Second, our calculation of reported billings may be different from other companies in our industry, some of which may not use reported billings, may calculate reported billings differently, may have different reported billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of reported billings as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating reported billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consumer reported billings: We define consumer reported billings as total revenue plus the change in adjusted contract liabilities excluding amounts related to our ID Analytics solutions. ID Analytics solutions were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We are presenting consumer reported billings to provide readers with a better understanding of the impact from the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions on the historical performance of our consumer business and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods. This metric is subject to the same limitations as reported billings discussed above. Bookings: Bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future. We present the operational metric of bookings because it reflects customers' demand for our products and services and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods. Free cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and thus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues: Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues are defined as revenues adjusted for foreign exchange impact, calculated by translating current period revenue using the year ago currency conversion rate. Consumer revenues: Consumer revenues exclude revenues from our ID Analytics solutions, which was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We are presenting consumer revenues to provide readers with a better understanding of the impact from the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions on our historical results and to assist readers in analyzing results in future periods. Consumer Cyber Safety direct customer count: Direct customers are defined as active paid users of our consumer solutions who have a direct billing relationship with us at the end of the reported period. Users with multiple products or entitlements are counted for based on which solutions they are subscribed. We exclude users on free trials and promotions and users who have indirectly purchased our product or services through partners unless such users convert or renew their subscription directly with us. Average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the fiscal quarter. Consumer Cyber Safety direct average revenues per user (ARPU): ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base. Annual retention rate: Annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a one-year tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago. We monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.",

Under the terms of the merger Avast shareholders will be entitled to receive a combination of cash consideration and newly issued shares in NortonLifeLock with alternative consideration elections available. Based on NortonLifeLock\u2019s closing share price of USD 27.20 on July 13, 2021 (being the last trading day for NortonLifeLock shares before market speculation began in relation to the merger on July 14, 2021, resulting in the commencement of the offer period), the merger values Avast\u2019s entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital between approximately USD 8.1B and USD 8.6B, depending on Avast shareholders\u2019 elections. The boards of NortonLifeLock and Avast believe that the merger has compelling strategic and financial rationale and represents an attractive opportunity to create a new, industry-leading consumer Cyber Safety business, leveraging the established brands, technology and innovation of both groups to deliver substantial benefits to consumers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. \u201cThis transaction is a huge step forward for consumer Cyber Safety and will ultimately enable us to achieve our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital lives safely,\u201d said Vincent Pilette, Chief Executive Officer of NortonLifeLock. \u201cWith this combination, we can strengthen our Cyber Safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users. We will also have the ability to further accelerate innovation to transform Cyber Safety.\u201d \u201cAt a time when global cyber threats are growing, yet cyber safety penetration remains very low, together with NortonLifeLock, we will be able to accelerate our shared vision of providing holistic cyber protection for consumers around the globe,\u201d said Ond\u0159ej Vl\u010dek, Chief Executive Officer of Avast. \u201cOur talented teams will have better opportunities to innovate and develop enhanced solutions and services, with improved capabilities from access to superior data insights. Through our well-established brands, greater geographic diversification and access to a larger global user base, the combined businesses will be poised to access the significant growth opportunity that exists worldwide.\u201d Strategic and Financial Benefits Accelerates the transformation of consumer Cyber Safety with over 500 million users; Combines Avast\u2019s strength in privacy and NortonLifeLock\u2019s strength in identity, creating a broad and complementary product portfolio, beyond core security and towards adjacent trust-based solutions; Strengthens geographic diversification and facilitates expansion into the SOHO / VSB segments; Unlocks significant value creation through approximately USD 280 million of annual gross cost synergies1, with additional upside potential from new reinvestment capacity for innovation and growth; Brings together two strong and highly experienced consumer-focused management teams. The Merger will also enhance the financial profile of the combined company through increased scale, long-term growth, cost synergies with reinvestment capacity and strong cash flow generation supported by a resilient balance sheet, and is expected to drive double-digit EPS accretion within the first full year following completion of the Merger and double-digit revenue growth in the long-term. Organization and Management Following the completion of the transaction, NortonLifeLock\u2019s CEO, Vincent Pilette, will remain CEO, NortonLifeLock\u2019s CFO, Natalie Derse, will remain CFO, and Avast\u2019s CEO, Ond\u0159ej Vl\u010dek, is expected to join NortonLifeLock as President and become a member of the NortonLifeLock Board of Directors.

Forward-looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the NortonLifeLock group and the Avast group. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201caim\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects, (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of NortonLifeLock or Avast, and (iii) the effects of government regulation on the business of NortonLifeLock or Avast. There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include the possibility that the transaction will not be completed on a timely basis or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the transaction (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganisation activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the combined company to realise successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the transaction is implemented, the inability of the combined company to integrate successfully NortonLifeLock\u2019s and Avast\u2019s operations when (and if) the transaction is implemented and the combined company incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the transaction when (and if) it is implemented. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of NortonLifeLock\u2019s most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this press release. These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this press release may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this press release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this press release.

Quantified financial benefit statement This press release contains statements of estimated cost savings and synergies (together, the \u201cQuantified Financial Benefits Statement\u201d) arising from the proposed acquisition of Avast by NortonLifeLock (the \u201cMerger\u201d). A copy of the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is set out below: \u201cGiven the complementary nature of both NortonLifeLock and Avast, the NortonLifeLock Directors believe that the Merger will generate synergies that could not be achieved independently of the Merger and will lead to significant long-term value creation for all shareholders. Significant recurring cost synergies opportunity NortonLifeLock anticipates that the Merger will result in recurring annual pre-tax gross cost synergies for the Combined Company to reach a run-rate of approximately USD 280 million, representing between approximately 15% and 20% of combined adjusted cost of sales and operating spend, based on the latest full year reported results for each of NortonLifeLock and Avast. The synergies are expected to be fully realised by the end of the second year following completion of the Merger. NortonLifeLock intends to approach integration with the aim of retaining and motivating the best talent and structure across the Combined Company to create a best-in-class organisation. The expected sources of the identified cost synergies are as follows: Organisation: approximately 50% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be generated through the adoption of shared best practice across existing functions and the reduction of duplicate roles across all geographies, and from a broad range of job categories, including management, shared services, product and commercial functions; Systems & Infrastructure operating costs: approximately 25% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be realised through migration onto a common data and security platform, integration of systems, and shared technology and analytics infrastructure; and Contracts & Shared Services: approximately 25% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be generated primarily from site rationalisation, procurement and vendor consolidation, and spend de-duplication. NortonLifeLock expects to realise approximately 60% of the run-rate cost savings by the end of the first full year following completion of the Merger and 100% by the end of the second full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits. On a reported basis, the synergies assume the Combined Company expects to benefit from approximately USD 75 million of cost savings in the first full year following completion of the Merger, approximately USD 245 million of cost savings in the second full year following completion of the Merger, and the full USD 280 million of the cost savings in the third full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits. One-off costs In order to realise these synergies, NortonLifeLock is expected to incur one-off restructuring and integration costs of approximately one year\u2019s run-rate pre-tax cost savings, or USD 280 million, with approximately USD 180 million estimated to be incurred in the first full year following completion of the Merger and approximately USD 100 million estimated to be incurred in the second full year following completion of the Merger. Aside from integration costs, no material dis-benefits are expected to arise in connection with the Merger. The expected synergies will accrue as a direct result of the Merger and would not be achieved on a standalone basis. The paragraphs above relating to expected cost synergies constitute a \u201cQuantified Financial Benefits Statement\u201d for the purposes of Rule 28 of the Code. Given the strong strategic, cultural and operational fit of the two companies, NortonLifeLock believes that the quantified cost synergies are readily achievable. NortonLifeLock expects to achieve the quantified cost synergies while maintaining appropriate investment levels in sales and technology to meet the Combined Company\u2019s growth targets and other objectives. The estimated cost synergies referred to above reflect both the beneficial elements and the relevant costs.\u201d Further information on the bases of belief supporting the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, including the principal assumptions and sources of information, is set out below. Bases of belief and principal assumptions In preparing the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, a synergy working group comprising senior strategy, operations, technical, sales and financial personnel from NortonLifeLock (the \u201cWorking Group\u201d) was established to identify, challenge and quantify the potential synergies available from the integration of the NortonLifeLock and Avast businesses, and to undertake an initial planning exercise. In preparing the detailed synergy plan, both NortonLifeLock and Avast have shared certain operating and financial information to support the evaluation of the potential synergies available from the Merger and have conducted a series of virtual meetings with the key management personnel of both NortonLifeLock and Avast. This has included input from both the NortonLifeLock and Avast executive leadership teams. Based on the information shared and interactions with Avast, the Working Group has performed a bottom-up analysis of costs included in the NortonLifeLock and Avast financial information and has sought to include in the synergy analysis those costs which the Working Group believe will be either optimized or reduced as a result of the Merger. In circumstances where the information provided by Avast has been limited for commercial or other reasons, the Working Group has made estimates and assumptions to aid its development of individual synergy initiatives. The assessment and quantification of the potential synergies have in turn been informed by NortonLifeLock management\u2019s industry experience as well as their experience of executing and integrating acquisitions in the past. The baseline used as the basis for the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is NortonLifeLock\u2019s adjusted cost base for the financial year ended 2 April 2021, supported where relevant by certain information from NortonLifeLock\u2019s budgeted cost base for the financial year ending 1 April 2022, and Avast\u2019s adjusted cost base for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, supported where relevant by certain information from Avast\u2019s budgeted cost base for the financial year ending 31 December 2021. The quantified synergies are incremental to NortonLifeLock\u2019s and, to the best of NortonLifeLock\u2019s knowledge, Avast\u2019s existing plans. In general, the synergy assumptions have in turn been risk adjusted, exercising a degree of prudence in the calculation of the estimated synergy benefit set out above. In arriving at the estimate of synergies set out in the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, the NortonLifeLock management has made the following assumptions: regarding organisational savings: savings will be possible by removing duplicate resource through the roll-out of the revised operating model; the Combined Company will be able to standardise and roll-out best practice systems and procedures, to generate efficiency and enable headcount reductions; and no restrictions or delays will arise as a result of industrial relations or employment agreements that significantly affect the realisation of savings by removing duplicate resource; savings will be possible by removing duplicate resource through the roll-out of the revised operating model; the Combined Company will be able to standardise and roll-out best practice systems and procedures, to generate efficiency and enable headcount reductions; and no restrictions or delays will arise as a result of industrial relations or employment agreements that significantly affect the realisation of savings by removing duplicate resource; there will be no material impact on the underlying operations of either company or their ability to continue to conduct their businesses, including as a result of, or in connection with, the integration of the Avast Group and the NortonLifeLock Group; the Combined Company\u2019s product offering generates at least the same level of total revenues as the Avast Group\u2019s and NortonLifeLock Group\u2019s offerings currently generate; procurement savings can be realised through rationalising suppliers and renegotiating supplier terms; there will be no material change to macroeconomic, political, regulatory, legal or tax conditions in the markets or regions in which NortonLifeLock and Avast operate that will materially impact the implementation of, or costs to achieve, the expected cost savings; there will be no material divestments from the existing businesses of either NortonLifeLock or Avast; there will be no material change in current foreign exchange rates; and there will be no business disruptions that materially affect either company, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks and/or technological issues or supply chain disruptions. Reports As required by Rule 28.1(a) of the Code, Deloitte, as reporting accountants to NortonLifeLock, and Evercore Partners International LLP, as financial adviser to NortonLifeLock, have provided the reports required under that Rule. Copies of these reports are included in the announcement made by NortonLifeLock Inc. and Avast plc on or about the date of this announcement. Notes The Quantified Financial Benefits Statement relates to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies. In addition, due to the scale of the Combined Company, there may be additional changes to the Combined Company\u2019s operations. As a result, the estimated synergies referred to may not be achieved, or may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. The Quantified Financial Benefits Statement should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that NortonLifeLock\u2019s earnings in the first full year following completion of the Merger, or in any subsequent period, will necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of NortonLifeLock or Avast for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. For the purposes of Rule 28 of the Code, the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is the responsibility of NortonLifeLock and the NortonLifeLock Directors. 1 Following completion of the merger.

        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ: NLOK), a global leader in consumer Cyber Safety, today introduced new features to Norton Family that provide an easy, safe and secure way for parents to remotely supervise their children with location-based boundaries and alerts. \u201cAs children of all ages return to school in-person, many parents will want to be aware of their kids\u2019 whereabouts as they spend more time outside the home,\u201d said Gagan Singh, chief product officer at NortonLifeLock. \u201cWe\u2019ve added new personalized features to our Norton Family product to help make it easier and more secure for parents to be connected with their children who are on the go.\u201d Norton has added new features1 to Norton Family, including: Favorite Locations: Helps parents establish approved geographic locations as favorite locations. Once set, parents will receive notifications when their child\u2019s device arrives or departs those set locations. Alert Me: Automatically allows parents to easily stay informed about their child\u2019s location. Parents can set specific dates and times to receive automatic check-in alerts from the location of their child\u2019s device. With parental controls to address Cyber Safety risks and establish healthy online habits, Norton Family provides a truly holistic solution for parents to help ensure their children are protected and staying safe online. As the school year begins across the country, these parental controls and safety measures are even more important as children spend an increasing amount of time online across multiple devices for education purposes. To help children of all ages stay safe this school year, Norton has provided the following tips for parents to manage cyber risks: Talk About Cyber Safety Early: A recent study conducted online by The Harris Poll found that Americans think conversations about online safety should start young, with more than 4 in 5 Americans (84%) feeling it\u2019s absolutely essential or very important for parents to teach their children about Cyber Safety. As young children enter school and start to establish their independence, it\u2019s important to provide a basic understanding of online safety by addressing topics like: The dangers of the internet, including suspicious activity, phishing scams and what to do if something seems unusual. Make it clear that laptops and devices should never be left unattended and that lock screens should be used to add further protection. Cyberbullying and the dangers of online predators. Parents can set rules that their young children can only chat or game online with people whom they\u2019ve already met in real life. The importance of creating strong passwords that are not recycled for multiple accounts or are easy to guess. Digitally-savvy Tweens and Teens Still Need Guidance: Tweens and teens may be more digitally advanced than ever before, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have the best judgment when it comes to staying safe online. Parents of children in this age group can further protect their kids by educating them on the following: The importance of protecting their identity. It\u2019s important to remind children not to reveal too much information about themselves online. For example, a teen may not think twice about sharing a picture of their license after passing their driver\u2019s test, but that could provide a treasure trove of sensitive and valuable information for identity thieves and cybercriminals. The importance of keeping privacy settings on to ensure personal information isn\u2019t intercepted by a hacker. Mitigating risks when connecting to public Wi-Fi. As teens may go to coffee shops or public libraries to complete school assignments individually or in a group setting, make it clear that cybercriminals consider public Wi-Fi an easy access point to get hold of sensitive data and encourage them to take steps to protect their online privacy and security by using a VPN.
