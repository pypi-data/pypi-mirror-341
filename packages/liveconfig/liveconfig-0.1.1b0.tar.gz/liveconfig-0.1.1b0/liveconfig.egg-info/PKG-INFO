Metadata-Version: 2.4
Name: liveconfig
Version: 0.1.1b0
Summary: Python package for developers which allows the live editing of class instance attributes to ease development of large python programs. LiveConfig will allow you to interact with values during program execution through an interface of your choice. Values can be saved, and loaded on startup.

# **LiveConfig** - v0.1.1-beta

LiveConfig is a Python package that allows developers to edit variables in real-time. All variables can be saved to a .json file and loaded automatically on startup. No more restarting your program every time you make a minor adjustment.

> ⚠️ This is a beta release (v0.1.1-beta). APIs and features may change in future updates.

## Features

- Class attribute editing - Edit attributes of class instances in real-time.
- File-handling - Attributes and values are saved to a file and automatically loaded on startup.
- Multiple interfaces\* - Interact with LiveConfig through the command line or a web interface.
- Easy to use - Adding an instance to LiveConfig only requires editing one line of code.

\* Interface system is under development — currently supports CLI and basic web interface. More coming soon!

## Installation

```bash
pip install liveconfig
```

## Usage

```python
from liveconfig import LiveConfig, liveclass, liveinstance, start_interface
# Initialize LiveConfig with the path to your JSON save file, do this before any other imports
LiveConfig("./files/variables.json")

# Start the user interface — use "cli" or "web" (more coming soon)
start_interface("web", port=5000)

# Decorate your class to make it live-editable
@liveclass
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        self.text = "Hello, World"
        self.width = 640
        self.height = 480

# Register an instance of the class for editing
config = liveinstance("config")(Config())

```

- `LiveConfig(path)` - **MUST** be done before importing any live classes or instances, recommended to do right after importing LiveConfig
- `@liveclass` - Marks a class so its instances can be tracked and edited.
- `liveinstance(name)` - Registers a specific instance for live editing, using the given name as its identifier.

## Future Features

- Support for functions and individual variables
- Support for databases
- More interface options
- Allow users to create their own interface
- Ability to prevent an attribute being changed.
- Ensure minimal overhead if LiveConfig is disabled.
- Function triggers, runs a function once.

## About

LiveConfig is a lightweight Python package that lets you update variables at runtime—perfect for live-tuning values in long-running processes like computer vision pipelines, simulations, or game logic. No more restarting your program for every tweak.
