# Getting Started

## What is thread-chunks
``thread-chunks`` is a wrapper around [ray](https://www.ray.io/) that allows for easier memory management. It is often the case in scientific computing that a task is both memory intensive and parallelisable. As the task is memory intensive then we may run out of memory when we parallelise the task. A solution to this is to compute a *chunk* of the tasks at once. If we increase the size of the chunk more memory will be used but the wall clock time will decrease.

Na√Øvely, we could execute each chunk in series. However, a more efficient solution is to set off the next task as soon as one finishes. This is exactly what ``thread-chunks`` handles for you.
## Installation

The python package can be installed with pip as follows:
```bash
pip install thread-chunks
```

## Quick Start

Suppose we wish to execute the function
```python
def f(x,y):
    return x+y
```
over a range of ``x`` and ``y``. We can do this in series with a for-loop:
```python
x_values = [1, 2, 3]
y_values = [4, 5, 6]
outputs = []
for x, y in zip(x_values, y_values):
    output = f(x, y)
    outputs.append(output)
```

We can parallelise this with ``thread-chunks`` as follows:
```python
from thread_chunks import chunk
outputs = chunk(f, [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]])
```
