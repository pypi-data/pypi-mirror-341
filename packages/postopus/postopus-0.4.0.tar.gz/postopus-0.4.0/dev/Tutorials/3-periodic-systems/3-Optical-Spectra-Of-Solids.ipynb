Two methods will be presented, one for computing the optical conductivity from the electronic current and another one computing directly the dielectric function using the so-called “gauge-field” kick method. Note that some of the calculations in this tutorial are quite heavy computationally, so they might require to run in parallel over a several cores to finish in a reasonable amount of time."

    "Compared to the previous TD calculation, we have made few changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [GaugeVectorField](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/hamiltonian/gaugevectorfield): This activates the calculation of the gauge field and its output. This replaces the laser field used in the previous method.\n",
    "* [KPointsGrid](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/kpoints/kpointsgrid): We used here a much denser ‘‘k’'-point grid. This is needed because of the numerical instability of the gauge-field method for very low number of ‘‘k’'-points.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this input file with **Octopus**, we can run the utility oct-dielectric-function , which produces the output td.general/dielectric_function . In this case we are interested in the imaginary part of the dielectric function along the ‘‘x’’ direction, which correspondents to the third column of the file. You can see how the spectra looks like in Fig. 2. As we can see, below the bandgap, we observe some numerical noise. This is again due to the fact that the spectrum is not properly converged with respect to the number of ‘‘k’'-points and vanishes if sufficient ‘‘k’'-points are used. Apart from this, we now obtained a much more converged spectrum, with the main three features starting to resemble the fully-converged spectrum."
