    "Lets see more in detail some of the input variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PeriodicDimensions](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/system/periodicdimensions) = 3: this input variable must be set equal to the number of dimensions you want to consider as periodic. Since the system is 3D ([Dimensions](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/system/dimensions)) = 3 is the default), by setting this variable to 3 we impose periodic boundary conditions at all borders. This means that we have a fully periodic infinite crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [LatticeVectors](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/simulation_box/latticevectors) and [LatticeParameters](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/simulation_box/latticeparameters): these two blocks are used to define the primitive lattice vectors that determine the unit cell. [LatticeVectors](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/simulation_box/latticevectors) defines the direction of the vectors, while [LatticeParameters](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/simulation_box/latticeparameters) defines their length.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ReducedCoordinates](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/system/coordinates/reducedcoordinates): the position of the atoms inside the unit cell, in reduced coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [KPointsGrid](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/kpoints/kpointsgrid): this specifies the ''k''-point grid to be used in the calculation. Here we employ a 2x2x2 Monkhorst-Pack grid with four shifts. The first line of the block defines the number of ''k''-points along each axis in the Brillouin zone. Since we want the same number of points along each direction, we have defined the auxiliary variable `nk = 2` This will be useful later on to study the convergence with respect to the number of ''k''-points. The other four lines define the shifts, one per line, expressed in reduced coordinates of the Brillouin zone. Alternatively, one can also define the reciprocal-space mesh by explicitly setting the position and weight of each ''k''-point using the [KPoints](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/kpoints/kpoints) or [KPointsReduced](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/kpoints/kpointsreduced) variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [KPointsUseSymmetries](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/kpoints/kpointsusesymmetries) = yes: this variable controls if symmetries are used or not. When symmetries are used, the code shrinks the Brillouin zone to its irreducible portion and the effective number of ''k''-points is adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Output](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/output/output) = dos: we ask the code to output the density of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have taken the value of the grid spacing to be 0.5 bohr. Although we will use this value throughout this tutorial, remember that in a real-life calculation the convergence with respect to the grid spacing must be performed for all quantities of interest.\n",
    "Note that for periodic systems the default value for the [Boxshape](https://www.octopus-code.org/documentation//13/variables/mesh/simulation_box/boxshape) variable is parallelepiped, although in this case the name can be misleading, as the actual shape also depends on the lattice vectors.
