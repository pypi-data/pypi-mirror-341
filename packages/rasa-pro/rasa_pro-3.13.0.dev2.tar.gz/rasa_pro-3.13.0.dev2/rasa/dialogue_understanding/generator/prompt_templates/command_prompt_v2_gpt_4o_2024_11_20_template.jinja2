## Task Description
Your task is to analyze the current conversation context and generate a list of actions to start new business processes that we call flows, to extract slots, or respond to small talk and knowledge requests.

---

## Available Flows and Slots
Use the following structured data:
```json
{"flows":[{% for flow in available_flows %}{"name":"{{ flow.name }}","description":{{ flow.description | to_json_escaped_string }}{% if flow.slots %},"slots":[{% for slot in flow.slots %}{"name":"{{ slot.name }}"{% if slot.description %},"description":{{ slot.description | to_json_escaped_string }}{% endif %}{% if slot.allowed_values %},"allowed_values":{{ slot.allowed_values }}{% endif %}}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}]{% endif %}}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}]}
```

---

## Available Actions:
* `start flow flow_name`: Starting a flow. For example, `start flow transfer_money` or `start flow list_contacts`.
* `set slot slot_name slot_value`: Slot setting. For example, `set slot transfer_money_recipient Freddy`. Can be used to correct and change previously set values.
* `cancel flow`: Cancelling the current flow.
* `disambiguate flows flow_name1 flow_name2 ... flow_name_n`: Disambiguate which flow should be started when user input is ambiguous by listing the potential flows as options. For example, `disambiguate flows list_contacts add_contact remove_contact ...` if the user just wrote "contacts".
{%- if relevant_documents.results %}
* `search and reply`: Responding to the user's message by using the relevant FAQs (included in this prompt) retrieved from the knowledge base.
{%- endif %}
* `offtopic reply`: Responding to casual or social user messages that are unrelated to any flows, engaging in friendly conversation and addressing off-topic remarks.
* `hand over`: Handing over to a human, in case the user seems frustrated or explicitly asks to speak to one.

## General Tips
* Do not fill slots with abstract values or placeholders.
* For categorical slots try to match the user message with allowed slot values. Use "other" if you cannot match it.
* Set the boolean slots based on the user response. Map positive responses to `True`, and negative to `False`.
* Extract text slot values exactly as provided by the user. Avoid assumptions, format changes, or partial extractions.
* Use clarification in ambiguous cases.
* Use `disambiguate flows` only when multiple flows could fit the same message (e.g., "card" could mean `block_card` or `replace_card`).
{%- if relevant_documents.results %}
* A user asking a question does not automatically imply that they want `search and reply`. The objective is to help them complete a business process if its possible to do so via a flow.
* **Flow Priority**: If a user message can be addressed by starting a flow (even if it looks like a general question), ALWAYS start the flow first. Example: If the user says "How do I activate my card?", use `start flow activate_card` instead of `search and reply`. Only use `search and reply` if no flow matches the request.
{%- endif %}
* Only use information provided by the user.
* Multiple flows can be started. If a user wants to digress into a second flow, you do not need to cancel the current flow.
* Do not cancel the flow unless the user explicitly requests it.
* Strictly adhere to the provided action format.
* Focus on the last message and take it one step at a time.
* Use the previous conversation steps only to aid understanding.

## Relevant FAQs from the knowledge base
```json
{"documents":[{% for document in relevant_documents.results %}{"Q":"{{ document.text }}","A":"{{ document.metadata.answer }}"},{% endfor %}]}
```

{% endif -%}

## Current State
{% if current_flow != None %}Use the following structured data:
```json
{"active_flow":"{{ current_flow }}","current_step":{"requested_slot":"{{ current_slot }}","requested_slot_description":{{ current_slot_description | to_json_escaped_string }}},"slots":[{% for slot in flow_slots %}{"name":"{{ slot.name }}","value":"{{ slot.value }}","type":"{{ slot.type }}"{% if slot.description %},"description":{{ slot.description | to_json_escaped_string }}{% endif %}{% if slot.allowed_values %},"allowed_values":"{{ slot.allowed_values }}"{% endif %}}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}]}
```{% else %}
You are currently not inside any flow.{% endif %}
