This is a tool to convert bare .pyd files to a wheel file such that they can be installed.

```shell
pyd2wheel .\mybinary.cp310-win_amd64.pyd --package_version 1.0.0
```

or from python:

```python
from python_build_utils import pyd2wheel
pyd2wheel("mybinary.cp310-win_amd64.pyd", package_version="1.0.0")
```

This will create a wheel file named in the same directory as the input file.

Note: The version argument is used only if the version is not already present in the filename (like in the example above).
