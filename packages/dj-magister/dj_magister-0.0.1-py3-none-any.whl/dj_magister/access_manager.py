class AccessManager:
    """
    A class responsible for managing access control relationships between resources
    within a given schema.

    The `AccessManager` facilitates operations such as creating, querying, and managing
    access control relationships between resources defined in the schema. It uses a
    `RelationshipWriter` to handle the creation of relationships and queries related
    to these relationships. The schema defines how resources are structured,
    related, and the permissions associated with those relationships.

    Example schema:
        schema = {
            "user": {},
            "document": {
                "relations": {
                    "owner": ["user"],
                    "editor": ["user"],
                    "reader": ["user", "group#member"],
                    "parent": ["document"]
                },
                "permissions": {
                    "read": ["owner", "editor", "reader", "parent->read"],
                    "write": ["owner", "editor", "parent->editor"]
                }
            }
        }

    Attributes:
        schema (Dict[str, SchemaResource]): A dictionary mapping resource names to
            `SchemaResource` objects defining the relationships, permissions, and
             structure for each resource.
        writer (RelationshipWriter): A writer instance responsible for performing
             operations such as creating or querying relationship records based
             on the schema.

    Methods:
        __init__(schema: Dict): Initializes the `AccessManager` with the provided schema

        create_from_dict(relationship_dict: Dict) -> QuerySet: Creates relationships
            from a dictionary representation and returns a `QuerySet` of created
            relationships.

        create_bulk(relationships: List[RelationTuple]) -> QuerySet: Creates multiple
            relationships in bulk from a list of `RelationTuple` instances and returns a
            `QuerySet` of the created relationships.

        has_permission(
            namespace: str,
            object_id: str,
            userset_namespace: str,
             permission: str,
            subject_id: str) -> bool: Checks if a subject has a specific permission on
                a given object in the specified namespace and userset.

        lookup_subjects(
            namespace: str,
            permission: str,
            userset_namespace: str,
            object_id: str | List[str],
            only_query: bool = False) -> QuerySet | List[str]: Looks up subjects based
                on the provided namespace, permission, userset namespace, and object
                ID(s).
                Can either return a query for the subjects or the resolved subjects,
                depending on the value of `only_query`.

        lookup_resources(
            namespace: str,
            permission: str,
            userset_namespace: str,
