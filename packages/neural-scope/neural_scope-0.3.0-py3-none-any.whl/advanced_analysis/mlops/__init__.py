Neural-Scope MLOps Integration Module

This package provides tools for integrating Neural-Scope analysis and optimization
capabilities into MLOps workflows, including:

1. CI/CD pipeline integration
2. MLflow experiment tracking
3. Kubeflow pipeline components
4. Model registry integration
5. Automated optimization workflows

The module is designed to streamline the integration of Neural-Scope's analysis
and optimization capabilities into production ML workflows.
