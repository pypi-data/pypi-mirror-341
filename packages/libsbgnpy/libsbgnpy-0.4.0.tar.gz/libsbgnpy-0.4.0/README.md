Python library to work with the Systems Biology Graphical Notation ([SBGN](http://sbgn.github.io/sbgn/)). This library is based on the SBGN XML schema and supports reading,
writing and validation of SBGN files.

The initial library was generated using [xsdata](https://github.com/tefra/xsdata). Additional utility functions for reading, writing, and rendering SBGN documents are provided.

Documentation with examples is available at https://matthiaskoenig.github.io/libsbgnpy/.
