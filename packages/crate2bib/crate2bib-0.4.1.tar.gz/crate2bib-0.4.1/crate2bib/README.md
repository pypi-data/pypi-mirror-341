# crate2bib

This crate searches for packages and versions and creates a BibLaTeX entry.
If a `CITATION.cff` file is present in the repository, the BibLaTeX file associated with that will
also be displayed.
The crate can be used in a web version under
[jonaspleyer.github.io/crate2bib](https://jonaspleyer.github.io/crate2bib).
