  complete audit trail for tracking and compliance.

- **Columnar storage for speed**  
  Fully denormalized, column‑partitioned tables deliver lightning‑fast queries,
  even with thousands of columns.

- **Built‑in RBAC security**  
  Define users and roles to control row‑ and column‑level access—no external
  security tools required.

- **Platform independent**  
  Deploy on any major cloud provider or on‑premise. SuperTable is a pure Python
  library with no hidden costs.
