## Usage Guide

### Installing the Package

To use `dataengine`, you can install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dataengine
```

### Adding to Your Project's Requirements

If you want to include dataengine as a dependency for your project, add it to your **requirements.txt** file:

```bash
dataengine
```

Then, install the updated requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, you can start using dataengine in your Python scripts or applications.

### How to use the package

In **dataengine** the primary class that will drive everything is the **Engine** class. For each instance of Engine you can specify the different subclasses through a configuration file or files. The different subclasses include the **Database**, **Dataset**, and **Query** classes.

- An instance of **Database** defines a single database you will interact with
- An instance of **Dataset** defines where to load data from using Apache spark (it can be locally or in s3)
- An instance of **Query** defines what datasets are input dependencies, what the SQL statments you would like to run are, where the output of the query will be saved, and if the result should be inserted into a database along with custom parameters for each
