The [**signac** framework](https://signac.readthedocs.io/) helps users manage and scale file-based workflows, facilitating data reuse, sharing, and reproducibility.

It provides a simple and robust data model to create a well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata.
This makes it easier to operate on large data spaces, streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data collectively accessible.

## Resources

- [Framework documentation](https://signac.readthedocs.io/):
  Examples, tutorials, topic guides, and package Python APIs.
- [Package documentation](https://signac.readthedocs.io/projects/core/):
  API reference for the **signac** package.
- [Discussion board](https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac/discussions/):
  Ask the **signac** user community for help.

## Installation

The recommended installation method for **signac** is through **conda** or **pip**.
The software is tested for Python 3.8+ and is built for all major platforms.

To install **signac** *via* the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) channel, execute:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge signac
```

To install **signac** *via* **pip**, execute:

```bash
pip install signac
```

**Detailed information about alternative installation methods can be found in the [documentation](https://signac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).**

## Quickstart

The framework facilitates a project-based workflow.
Set up a new project:

```bash
$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project
$ signac init
```

and access the project handle:

```python
>>> project = signac.get_project()
```

## Testing

You can test this package by executing:

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/
```

## Acknowledgment

When using **signac** as part of your work towards a publication, we would really appreciate that you acknowledge **signac** appropriately.
We have prepared examples on how to do that [here](https://signac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acknowledge.html).
