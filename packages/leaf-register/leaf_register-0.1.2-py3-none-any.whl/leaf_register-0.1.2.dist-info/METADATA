# LEAF-Register
LEAF-Register is a designed to describe and capture the communication language between an adapter (proxy) and its client. This repository is structured to define and manage equipment terms and metadata for interaction within a system. The Register will likely be embedded within another tool to handle the capture of equipment metadata, the generation and validation of topics and identification of partial topics.
