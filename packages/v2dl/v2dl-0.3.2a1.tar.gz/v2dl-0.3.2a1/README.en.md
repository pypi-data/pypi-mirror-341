# V2PH Downloader

V2PH Downloader

## Features

📦 Plug-and-play: No extra dependencies required  
🌐 Cross-platform: Supports all platforms  
🔄 Dual engines: Supports both DrissionPage and Selenium automation options  
🛠️ Convenient: Supports multiple accounts for auto-login and switching, supports cookies/password login  
⚡️ Fast: High-efficiency download with asynchronous event loop  
🧩 Customizable: Offers many configuration options  
🔑 Secure: Uses PyNaCL as encryption backend  

## Installation

Requirements:

1. Chrome browser installed
2. Python version > 3.10
3. Install via pip

```sh
pip install v2dl
```

## Usage

On first run, login to V2PH with one of the two methods:

1. Account Management Interface  
Use `v2dl -a` to enter the account management interface.

```sh
v2dl -a
```

2. Cookies Login  

Logs in using cookies by specifying a cookies file. If the path is a directory, it will search for all `.txt` files containing "cookies" in their filename. This method adds the account to the login candidate list.  

```sh
v2dl -c /PATH/to/cookies
```

3. Manual Login  
Due to strict bot detection on login pages, you can trigger the login page by randomly downloading an album, then manually log in if errors occur.

### First Download Attempt

v2dl supports various download methods, including downloading a single album, a list of albums, starting from a specific album, or reading all pages from a text file.

```sh
# Download a single album
v2dl "https://www.v2ph.com/album/Weekly-Young-Jump-2015-No15"

# Download all albums in an album list
v2dl "https://www.v2ph.com/category/nogizaka46"

# Download all pages in a text file
v2dl -i "/path/to/urls.txt"
```

## Configuration

The program looks for a `config.yaml` file in the system configuration directory. Refer to the example in the root directory.

You can modify settings like scroll length, scroll step, and rate limit:

- download_dir: Set download location, defaults to system download folder.
- download_log_path: Tracks downloaded album URLs, skipped if duplicated; defaults to system configuration directory.
- system_log_path: Location for program logs; defaults to system configuration directory.
- rate_limit: Download speed limit, default is 400 (sufficient and prevents blocking).
- chrome/exec_path: Path to Chrome executable.

System configuration directory locations:

- Windows: `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\v2dl`
- Linux, macOS: `/Users/xxx/.config/v2dl`

### Cookies

Cookies login is often more successful than using username/password.

Use an extension (e.g., [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)) to export cookies in Netscape format, and input the exported cookie file path in the account manager tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Exported cookies must include `frontend-rmt/frontend-rmu`.

> [!NOTE]
> Cookies are sensitive information; use high-quality extensions and remove or restrict access after exporting.

### Parameters

- url: URL of the target to download.
- -i: URL list in a text file, one URL per line.
- -a: Enter the account management tool.
- -c: Specify the cookies file to be used for this execution. If the provided path is a folder, it will automatically search for all .txt files containing "cookies" in their names within that folder. This is especially useful for users who prefer not to use account management.
- -d: Configure the base download directory.
- --force: Force download without skipping.
- --range: Specifies the download range, following the same usage as `--range` in gallery-dl.
- --bot: Select automation tool; Drission is less likely to be blocked by bots.
- `--chrome-args`: Override the arguments used to launch Chrome. This is useful when the browser is being blocked or detected by bots. Usage: `--chrome-args "window-size=800,600//guest"`. [List of all available arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38335671/where-can-i-find-a-list-of-all-available-chromeoption-arguments).
- --user-agent: Override the user-agent, useful for bot-blocked scenarios.
- --terminate: Whether to close Chrome after the program ends.
- -q: Quiet mode.
- -v: Debug mode.

## Security Overview

> For fun, I included some seemingly unnecessary features like this security architecture. I mostly just glanced at the documentation, and this section was written while researching. I selected a lightweight 4MB package (while cryptography is 25MB).

Password storage uses PyNaCL, an encryption suite based on modern cryptography Networking and Cryptography (NaCl). The system uses a three-layer key architecture for defense in depth:

- The first layer uses the operating system's secure random source `os.urandom` to generate a 32-bit `encryption_key` and `salt` for key derivation using the advanced Argon2id algorithm, which combines Argon2i and Argon2d to defend against side-channel attacks and GPU brute-force cracking.

- The middle layer protects asymmetric key pairs with a master key using XSalsa20-Poly1305 with a 24-byte nonce to prevent password collisions. XSalsa20 enhances Salsa20 with greater security without hardware acceleration. Poly1305 ensures data integrity, preventing tampering during transmission.

- The outer layer implements encryption with SealBox, using Curve25519 for perfect forward secrecy, offering RSA-level security with shorter keys.

The keys are stored in a secure folder with access control, and encryption materials are stored separately in a `.env` file.

## Extend V2DL

You can also extend V2DL. An example code below demonstrates how to use custom default config and replace your own the web automation script.

```py
import asyncio
from v2dl import V2DLApp

custom_defaults = {
    "static_config": {
        "min_scroll_distance": 1000,
        "max_scroll_distance": 2000,
        # ...
    }
}


class CustomBot:
    def __init__(self, config_instance):
        self.config = config_instance

    def auto_page_scroll(self, full_url, page_sleep=0) -> str:
        # this function should return the html content for each album page
        print("Custom bot in action!")
        return """
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>

    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
</head>

<body>
<div>
    <h1>Example Domain</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a></p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
"""

class ExtendedV2DL(V2DLApp):
    def _setup_runtime_config(self, config_manager, args):
        super()._setup_runtime_config(config_manager, args)
        config_manager.set("runtime_config", "user_agent", "my_custom_ua")
        print("Custom config in action!")


bot_name = "my awesome bot"
command_line_args = {"url": "https://www.v2ph.com/album/foo", "force_download": True}

app = ExtendedV2DL()
app.register_bot(bot_name, CustomBot)
app.set_bot(bot_name)
asyncio.run(app.run(command_line_args))
```

## Additional Notes

1. Rapid page switching or fast downloads may trigger blocks. Current settings balance speed and block prevention.
2. Block likelihood depends on network environment. Avoid using VPN for safer downloads.
3. Use cautiously to avoid overloading the website's resources.
