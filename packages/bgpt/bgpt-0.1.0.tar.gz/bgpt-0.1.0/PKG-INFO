# bgpt - Bash GPT CLI Tool

A command-line tool that translates natural language commands into bash commands using OpenAI's language models.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

Before using `bgpt`, make sure you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set with your OpenAI API key. You can also set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable if you are using a custom OpenAI endpoint, and the `LLM_MODEL` environment variable to change the model. The default model is GPT-4.1-mini.

Example:
\`\`\`bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export LLM_MODEL="GPT-4.1-mini"
\`\`\`

```bash
bgpt <natural language command>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
bgpt create a folder named my-folder
bgpt list all files in the current directory
bgpt show me the contents of my_file.txt
```

The tool will then:

1. Generate a bash command based on your input.
2. Display the generated command and ask for confirmation.
3. Execute the command if you confirm.
4. Show the output of the command.

## Configuration

-   **OPENAI\_API_KEY:** You must set this environment variable to your OpenAI API key.
-   **OPENAI\_BASE_URL:** (Optional) Set this environment variable if you are using a custom OpenAI endpoint.
