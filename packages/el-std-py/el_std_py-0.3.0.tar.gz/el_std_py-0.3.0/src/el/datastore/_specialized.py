    """
    A class decorator to create "specialized" datastore file classes directly from pydantic
    data models:

    ```python
    @specialized_file
    class UserDataFile(pydantic.BaseModel):
        user_name: str = ""
        join_data: int = 0
        followers: int = 0
    ```

    SpecializedFile classes behave like the decorated model class, except they take the file 
    path as the initialization parameter. Type-Checkers will even believe that it is
    just the regular model after instantiation so all intellisense features will still work!
    
    So you can simply instantiate the above defined model and pass it the file path to store it. 
    After that you can use it like the regular data model but it will automatically save the data to disk:

    ```python
    user_data = UserDataFile(["user123423"])
    user_data.followers = 5
    ```

    Additionally, the specialized file decorator allows specifying a base path. This path will be prepended
    in front of the regular path passed to the file during instantiation:

    ```python
    @specialized_file(base_path=["users"])
    class UserDataFileOrganized(pydantic.BaseModel):
        user_name: str = ""
        join_data: int = 0
        followers: int = 0
    ```

    This is useful because you may want to group all datastore files of the same type together
    so they are more organized. For example, you might want to store every UserDataFile in a folder
    named "users", naming the file by the user name:

    ```python
    user_data_org = UserDataFileOrganized(["user123423"])
    user_data_org.followers = 5

    # Equivalent to the following without base path:
    user_data = UserDataFile(["users", "user123423"])
    user_data.followers = 5
    ```

    The two above variations are functionally equivalent, but with the base
    path you don't need to remember to specify the same base path everywhere a user file
    is accessed, which reduces the risk of bugs.
