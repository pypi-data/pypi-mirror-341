# zeitpy

ZeitPy is a package for time series analysis. Its main purpose is to abstract some vital operations to analyse time series data. At its core is the `Zeit` class, which provides attributes and methods for initializing a (Pandas) time series, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, visualize periodograms, seasonal, and lag plots, etc.), forecasting and performance assessment

---

## Class Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

### `Zeit`

#### **Class Initialization**
```python
In [1]: import zeitpy as zp
...: zo = zp.Zeit('sales_luanda.csv', date_format = '%Y-%m-%d', date_col = 'date', data_col = 'sales')
```

- **dataset**: the DataFrame, Series or csv file path containing the time series data.
- **date_format**: the format of the "date_col" instances to be converted into datetime.
- **date_col**: the column containing the time observations.
- **data_col**: the column containing the values (in case of csv files or DataFrames).

#### **Attributes and Methods**

- **`data`**
   - this attribute retrieves the time series data wrapped by the Zeit object.

- **`seasonal_decomposition(model: str = 'additive', period: int = 12, **plot_args) -> None`**
   - A method for plotting the seasonal decomposition of the time series using moving averages.
   - Parameters:
     - `model`: the type of seasonal decomposition
     - `period`: period of the series (12 for monthly data, 1 for annual, etc.)

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏èüì¶

### How to get the package?

#### Installation via PyPI
**`pip install zeitpy`**

#### Installation of source distribution (.tar.gz)
**`pip install path/to/zeitpy-0.1.1.tar.gz`**

#### Installation of pre-built distribution (.whl)
**`pip install path/to/zeitpy-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl`**

#### Cloning the package repository
**`git clone https://github.com/domingosdeeulariadumba/ZeitPy.git`**


### Importing the package

```python
In [1]: import zeitpy as zp
```

### Example: Injecting a dataset and accessing the first five records of the time series
```python
In [2]: zo = zp.Zeit('sales_luanda.csv', date_format = '%Y-%m-%d', date_col = 'date', data_col = 'sales')
...: zo.data.head()
