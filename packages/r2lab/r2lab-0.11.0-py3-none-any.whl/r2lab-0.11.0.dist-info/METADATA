# The `r2lab` python library

This python module contains, in no particular order, a set of
utilities that come in handy when working with the R2lab testbed - see
<https://r2lab.inria.fr>.

This library was built on an opportunistic basis; essentially, it
contains features that we found users copying and pasting from one
experience to another.

As such it addresses very different topics, but nothing in here should
be crucial or really hard to implement separately, it's mostly meant
as a set of convenient tools to help experimenter provide similar
functionalities.
