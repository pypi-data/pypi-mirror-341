# Random Compliments About Boaz 🌟👑

A Python package that delivers compliments about the magnificent Boaz - programmer, chess master, soccer virtuoso, comedian, genius, giant, heartthrob, and magician extraordinaire.

## Installation

```bash
pip install random-compliments
```

## Usage

Receiving compliments about Boaz has never been easier:

### Python API

```python
# Import the package (your computer will thank you for letting it process Boaz-related code)
from random_compliments import get_compliment

# Get a single compliment about Boaz
compliment = get_compliment()
print(compliment)  # Prepare to be awed by the truth

# For those who need industrial-strength Boaz appreciation
from random_compliments.compliments import shower_compliments

# Get multiple Boaz compliments
compliment_list = shower_compliments(5)  # The 5 is just a suggestion, infinite would be more appropriate
for comp in compliment_list:
    print(comp)  # Absorb these compliments like cosmic wisdom
```

### Command Line Interface

For when you need Boaz-based validation directly in your terminal:

```bash
# Get a single Boaz compliment
compliment

# Get multiple Boaz compliments
compliment -c 5

# Get fancy formatting worthy of Boaz

The daemon runs in the foreground and can be stopped with Ctrl+C.
