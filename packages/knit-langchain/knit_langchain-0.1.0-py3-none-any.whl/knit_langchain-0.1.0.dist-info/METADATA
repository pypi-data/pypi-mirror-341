# Knit LangChain SDK

Welcome to the Knit's LangChain SDK, a powerful toolkit designed to integrate AI-powered agents built using LangChain with a wide range of SaaS applications. 

As an embedded integration platform, Knit provides a white-labeled solution empowering SaaS companies to effortlessly scale integrations within their own products, enriching customer experiences with dynamic, out-of-the-box functionality.

The Knit LangChain SDK is designed to facilitate seamless integration between LLM agents and SaaS applications by leveraging Knit's platform and its wide range of connectors. 

## Installation

Kickstart your journey with the Knit LangChain SDK by installing it via pip:

```bash
pip install knit-langchain
```

## Quick Start

First, get your Knit API Key by signing up at [https://dashboard.getknit.dev/signup](https://dashboard.getknit.dev/signup)

Now, we're ready to start using the SDK. Here's a simple guide to help you start integrating with the Knit LangChain SDK:

```python
import logging
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from knit_langchain import KnitLangChain, ToolFilter

# Initialize the Knit SDK with your API key
knit = KnitLangChain(api_key="YOUR_KNIT_API_KEY")

# Initialize your Large Language Model (LLM)
model = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    model="gpt-4o",  # Choose the appropriate model, e.g., gpt-4o
    temperature=0,   # Set temperature for response variability
)

# Discover available tools from a specific app.
# Use app_id to filter tools for a particular application
tools = knit.find_tools(app_id="charliehr")

# Retrieve specific tools you want to pass to the LLM model.
# Use ToolFilter to select the required tools by their IDs
tool_defs = knit.get_tools(tools=[ToolFilter(app_id="charliehr", tool_ids=[tool.tool_id for tool in tools])])

# Define the conversation prompt template with predefined roles and placeholders
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant"),  # System message defining the agent role
        ("human", "{input}"),  # Placeholder for human input
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),  # Placeholder for intermediate steps
    ]
)

# Create the agent capable of using the defined tools and prompt
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(model, tools, prompt)

# Create an executor to run the agent with detailed output
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tool_defs, verbose=True)

# Configuration settings required for tool execution
config = {"knit_integration_id": "b29fcTlZc2IwSzViSUF1NXI5SmhqOHdydTpjaGFybGllaHI="}

# Invoke the agent to perform a task, supplying necessary inputs and configuration
agent_executor.invoke(
    {"input": "I want to get the list of offices of the company"},
    config={"configurable": config}
)
```

That's it! It's that easy to get started and add hundreds of SaaS applications to your AI Agent.
