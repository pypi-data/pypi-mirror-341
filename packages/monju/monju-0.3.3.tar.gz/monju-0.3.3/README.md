# monju: Multi-AI Brainstorming Framework

Monju is a powerful multi-AI brainstorming framework designed to generate, organize, and evaluate ideas using various Large Language Models (LLMs).

The Japanese proverb “三人寄れば文殊の知恵” (San nin yoreba monju no chie) is often translated into English as “Two heads are better than one”. However, a more literal translation would be “When three people gather, they have the wisdom of Manjushri”.

## Features

- Generate ideas based on a given theme
- Organize ideas into mindmaps and affinity diagrams (class diagrams)
- Evaluate generated ideas
- Support for multiple LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Customizable parameters for idea generation

The project started as a web app [monju.ai](https://monju.ai), which was released in July 2024.

This library is the core of monju.ai that does not include frontend part.

For general information of monju.ai, see my article from Medium "[***monju.ai: a creativity enhancement tool that uses multiple generative AIs to generate ideas and organize mind maps***](https://medium.com/@daicom0204/monju-ai-a-creativity-enhancement-tool-that-uses-multiple-generative-ais-to-generate-ideas-and-f13112313084)".

## Brainstorming Process by monju

For the general approach to brainstorming, see [Brainstorming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming).

The brainstorming process by monju consists of three main steps:

1. Generate ideas in list
2. Organize ideas in mindmap and class diagram in Mermaid
3. Evaluate ideas including overall, good points, and areas for improvement

Each step is implemented as a method in the `Monju` class.

Both mindmap and class diagram are described in Mermaid text format. Output can be drawn by any mermaid-compatible tools mainly in JavaScript, e.g. [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).

## KJ method (Affinity Diagram)

In Japan, another popular ideation tool "KJ method" is often used as part of brainstorming. This method might be known as "affinity diagram" in English.

The KJ method is to categorize ideas into groups based on their similarity. Each idea is written on a single card, then categorized into groups with labels.

People in Japan hesitate open discussion. Writing in cards and categorizing them into groups might help open mind.

In monju, affinity diagram is generated as class diagram of Mermaid. This process is called "pseudo KJ method" in this library.

For details of KJ method, see [Affinity diagram - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram).

## Installation

```bash
pip install monju
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- API keys for the LLM providers

This library uses `LLMMaster`, a unified interface to access major LLM providers. Set API keys following the instructions from [LLM Master](https://github.com/Habatakurikei/llmmaster), another repository by the same author.

## Usage

### Batch Execution

By just one call, all the steps of brainstorming can be done. Here is an typical example.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from monju import Monju

API_KEY = Path('your_api_keys.txt').read_text(encoding='utf-8')

# Use this function to arrange parameters in dictionary format.
def pack_parameters(**kwargs):
    return kwargs


# Initialize monju with your API keys and brainstorming parameters
params = pack_parameters(
    theme="How to survive in the era of emerging AI?",
    ideas=5,
    freedom=0.2,
    language="en"
)
bs = Monju(api_keys=API_KEY, verbose=True, reduction=True, **params)

# Start the brainstorming process
bs.brainstorm()

# Show the results
print(f'Result:\n{json.dumps(bs.record, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}')
```

Before running, set your API keys for the dedicated LLMs in `your_api_keys.txt`. The format shall be:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

By default, monju uses Anthropic, Google and OpenAI models. Keep in mind to secure handling of your API keys.

Information related to a session is stored in `bs.record` as `dict`. You can extract items you want, or print/save this record as JSON.

The parameter `verbose` prints progress on your screen if set `True` (default is `False`).

**NEW for v0.3.0**

The parameter `reduction` will try to remove duplicate ideas generated by multiple LLMs. It is often a hard work to manually adjust generated mindmap/affinity diagram consisting of many ideas on screen. By setting this parameter `True`, it may support reducing some similar ideas and make clearer mindmap and affinity diagram (default is `False`).

### Step-by-Step Execution

There is another way to use monju by calling each process step by step.

The following example works equivalently to the batch execution example above.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from monju import Monju
from monju.config import KEY_IDEA_REDUCTION
from monju.config import KEY_MINDMAP
from monju.config import KEY_CLASS_DIAGRAM


# Initialize monju with your API keys and brainstorming parameters
bs = Monju(
    api_keys=Path('your_api_keys.txt').read_text(encoding='utf-8'),
    verbose=True,
    reduction=True,
    **{
        "theme": "How to survive in the era of emerging AI?",
        "ideas": 5,
        "freedom": 0.2,
        "language": "en"
    }
)
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

bs.generate_ideas()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

bs.reduce_ideas(**{
    KEY_IDEA_REDUCTION: {
        "provider": "deepseek",
        "temperature": 0.0
    }
})
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

bs.organize_ideas(**{
    KEY_MINDMAP: {
        "provider": "deepseek",
        "temperature": 0.0
    },
    KEY_CLASS_DIAGRAM: {
        "provider": "deepseek",
        "temperature": 0.0
    }
})
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

bs.evaluate_ideas(**{
    "openai": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "o3-mini",
        "reasoning_effort": "high"
    },
    "anthropic": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
        "thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 10000},
        "max_tokens": 128000
    },
})
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

bs.verify()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

# Show the results
print(f'Result:\n{json.dumps(bs.record, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}')
```

The latest models of thinking/reasoning can also be used, especially for evaluation.

Types of `bs.status` are explained in later section.

### Input Parameters

There are several parameters to set for `Monju` class:

- Constractor parameters:
  - `api_keys` (str): API keys for LLMs in `LLMMaster` manner
  - `verbose` (bool): print progress for debugging, default is `False`
  - `reduction` (bool): remove duplicate ideas, default is `False`

  - `idea_list`: List of ideas. If `reduction = False`, this list is just a collection of `ideas`. If `reduction = True`, this list will be another list after the reduction process. This list is used for mindmap and affinity diagram generation.
  - `mindmap`: Mindmap for the idea list, given in Mermaid format.
  - `class_diagram`: Affinity diagram for the idea list, given in mermaid format.
  - `evaluation`: Evaluation of the generated ideas in dictionary format if multiple LLMs are used.

**Note:** In monju, the class diagram is used for affinity diagram expression.

There are 5 ideas generated by each LLM (15 ideas in total) to the theme, but 12 ideas are used for organization through the idea reduction.

### Elapsed Time

On average, one brainstorming session takes about 60 seconds to complete by monju. It dpends on how many ideas to generate by each LLM.

Since v0.3.0, it may take longer due to the idea reduction process. But still 120 seconds shoube be longest.

### Status

There are many calls of `print` in the step-by-step example. Each print shows a different status, which is useful to know progress.

Types of `bs.status` are as follows:

- `not_started`: The brainstorming process has not started. Most of cases, this status is shown when the instance of `Monju` is created.
- `idea_generation`: Generating ideas in progress or finished.
- `reducing`: Idea reduction in progress or finished.
- `organizing`: Organizing ideas in mindmap and affinity diagram in progress or finished.
- `idea_evaluation`: Evaluating ideas in progress or finished.
- `verifying`: Verifying if all the outputs are generated in progress or finished.
- `done`: The brainstorming process is completed.
- `failed`: The brainstorming process is failed at some step.

## Supported LLM Providers

One of the most important features of `Monju` is to generate ideas from multiple LLMs.

`Monju` currently sets the following LLM providers as default for idea generation and evaluation:

- OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- Google: `gemini-1.5-flash`

And OpenAI `gpt-4o` is set as default for idea reduction and organization of mindmap and class diagram.

Monju is capable of single or multiple LLMs for each step:

- Generate ideas (multiple/single LLM)
- Remove duplicate ideas (single LLM)
- Organize ideas in mindmap and class diagram (single LLM)
- Evaluate ideas (multiple/single LLM)

You can configure which providers and models to use for each step. Set arguments of LLM information in `params` dictionary by calling `generate_ideas(**params)`, `reduce_ideas(**params)`, `organize_ideas(**params)`, and `evaluate_ideas(**params)`.

This customization is not possible for the batch brainstorming.

Note that providers are not limited to those shown above. Also possible to user other providers like DeepSeek, MistralAI, Groq, Perplexity, Grok and so on, as possible as they are defined in `LLMMaster` class.
