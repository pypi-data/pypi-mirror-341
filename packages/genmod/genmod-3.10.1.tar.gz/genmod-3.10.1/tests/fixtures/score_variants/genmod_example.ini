# There are categories that have rules for how scores should be treated
# Min means that that the minimal score for all plugins in a category should be used
# Max means that that the max score for all plugins in a category should be used
# Sum means that all the scores within a category is summed into a category score
# The plugins follow the rules from extract_vcf to define how to get the correct value from the vcf
# Each plugin have sub categories that define how the scores are handled. There should allways be a 'not_scored' sub catogory,
# if it is lacking the score will be 0
# The sub categories have a score, an operator and a value
# Score is the what score will be given if the requirements are fulfilled
# operator can be [le, lt, gt, ge, eq, na]
# value is the value that the operator works on
