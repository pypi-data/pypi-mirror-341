## Overview

Peak shaving is a strategy to reduce energy costs by minimizing peak demand utilizing energy storage systems. This project provides tools to optimize a given consumption time series with peak-shaving reducing capacity costs and visualizing results using Grafana.

## Features

- Peak shaving optimization using [FINE by FZJ](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE)
- Easy configuration of many parameters
- Support for dynamic prices
- Inclusion of PV system integration with automatic retrieving of generation timeseries depending on location (with detection for leap years)
- Dockerized deployment with Grafana dashboards
- Example configurations for various scenarios

## Installation

You can install peakshaving-analyzer using pip. Choose the appropriate installation method based on your needs:

### Using pip

To install the core package:

```bash
pip install peakshaving-analyzer
```

### Timescale Database and Grafana Dashboards

If you want to benefit from a supported database and integrated Grafana dashboards for scenario analysis, you can use the provided Docker Compose file.

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NOWUM/peakshaving-analyzer.git
cd peakshaving-analyzer
```

2. Start the database and Grafana using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will launch a container for TimescaleDB and Grafana with preconfigured dashboards for analysis. You can access the Grafana dashboards at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

```
from peakshaving_analyzer import Config, PeakShavingAnalyzer


config = Config("/path/to/your/config/file.yml")
psa = PeakShavingAnalyzer(config=config)
```

The optimization can be adjusted by changing values in the `config.yml` file.

If you're connecting to your own database either create the predefined tables or set `overwrite_existing_optimization` to `False` on the first optimization.

## Examples

In the `examples` directory are four examples:
* A scenario examining only a storage system using hourly values with a fixed, non-dynamic price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining only a storage system using quarterhouly values with a fixed, non-dynamic price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining only a storage system using quarterhourly values with a dynamic, time-depended price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining a storage system as well as a photovoltaic system using hourly values with a dynamic, time-depended price for the used energy.

You can run these examples with `python3 ./examples/example/main.py` from the base directory.
