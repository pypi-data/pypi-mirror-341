## Typing stubs for flake8-bugbear

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`flake8-bugbear`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `flake8-bugbear`. This version of
`types-flake8-bugbear` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`flake8-bugbear==24.12.12`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
