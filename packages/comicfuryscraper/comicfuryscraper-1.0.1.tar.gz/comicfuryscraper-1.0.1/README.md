![URL Bar](https://github.com/enzomtpYT/ComicFury-Scrape/assets/40535918/78a2e591-6b3a-4fc0-b32f-ac79fac628dc)

Then execute (depending on how you installed it):

```
python cli.py -i COMIC_ID -d
```

OR

```
comicfuryscraper.exe -i COMIC_ID -d
```

OR

```
comicfuryscraper -i COMIC_ID -d
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-u, --url` | URL of the webpage to scrape |
| `-i, --id` | ID of the comic to scrape (alternative to URL) |
| `-t, --max-threads` | Maximum number of threads to use (default: 4) |
| `-d, --download` | Download the comic and create CBZ files |
| `-o, --output` | Output directory for downloaded files |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output |
| `-j, --json` | Path to a JSON file with chapter data (skips scraping) |

### Examples

1. Scrape comic information without downloading:

```
python cli.py -i yourcomicid
```

This will generate a `yourcomicid-chapters.json` file with all chapters and pages information.

2. Download a comic using its ID and save to a specific folder:

```
python cli.py -i yourcomicid -d -o "My Comics/ComicName"
```

3. Download a comic using its URL with verbose output:

```
python cli.py -u "https://comicfury.com/comicprofile.php?url=yourcomicid" -d -v
```

4. Increase download speed by using more threads:

```
python cli.py -i yourcomicid -d -t 8
```

5. Use a previously generated JSON file to download without scraping:

```
python cli.py -j yourcomicid-chapters.json -d
```

6. Download a comic using an existing JSON file and save to a specific directory:

```
python cli.py -j yourcomicid-chapters.json -d -o "My Comics/ComicName"
```

## How It Works

1. The scraper first checks if a JSON file with chapter data exists
   - If specified with `-j` flag, it uses that file
   - Otherwise, it looks for a default file named `[comic-id]-chapters.json`
2. If no JSON file is found, it scrapes all chapters from the comic's archive page
3. For each chapter, it finds all pages and their image URLs
4. When downloading, it creates a temporary directory for each chapter
5. Images are downloaded with proper ordering (001.jpg, 002.jpg, etc.)
6. A CBZ file is created for each chapter with numbered prefixes for proper ordering
7. Temporary directories are cleaned up automatically

## Output

Downloaded comics are saved as CBZ files in the specified output directory (or a directory named after the comic ID by default). Files are named with numerical prefixes to ensure proper ordering, for example:

```
01_Chapter_Name.cbz
02_Another_Chapter.cbz
etc...
```

## Limitations

- Only works on Comic With Infinite Scroll if comic has infinite scroll disabled, please use [ComicFury-Scrape](https://github.com/enzomtpYT/comicFury-Scrape)
