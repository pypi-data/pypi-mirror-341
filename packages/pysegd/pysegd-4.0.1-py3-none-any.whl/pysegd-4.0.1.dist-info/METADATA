# PySegd

Read/write SEG-D files in Python.

This project is rewritten and expanded after the version from [read_segd](https://github.com/claudiodsf/read_segd),  
licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPL v3), as a starting point.

## Main Changes (2022, M.L.)

- Dropped support for Python 2.
- Removed dependency on ObsPy, making the library standalone.  
  Traces can still be converted to ObsPy objects easily.
- Completely rewrote the program using object-oriented syntax.  
  Header fields and data arrays are decoded only on request, while remaining transparent for the user.

### August 2022, M.L.

- Implemented the writing of SEG-D files.

## How It Works

- The file is read using a `SegdFile` object organized as follows:
    - `SegDFile`
        - `BlockDecoders`
            - `TypeDecoders`
- The `BlockDecoders` are subclasses of the `BlockDecoder` class, which contains the structure for a given block of the file.  
- The `TypeDecoders` are attributes that handle a specific variable. They internally manage fields of the file header or data in binary or unpacked format.  
- When the user accesses a specific field, the decoder decodes the bytes on demand and returns the unpacked version, making the process transparent to the user.
