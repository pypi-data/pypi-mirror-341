The ``imod`` Python package is an open source project to make working with
MODFLOW groundwater models in Python easier. It builds on top of popular
packages such as `xarray`_, `pandas`_, `geopandas`_, `dask`_,  and `rasterio`_
to provide a versatile toolset for working with (large) groundwater (modeling)
data:

* Preparing and modifying data from a variety of GIS, scientific, and MODFLOW
  file formats;
* Writing data to MODFLOW-based models;
* Selecting and evaluating for e.g. time series comparison or water budgets;
* Visualizing cross sections, time series, or 3D animations.
  
We currently support the following MODFLOW-based models:

* `USGS MODFLOW 6`_, structured (DIS) and discretization by vertices (DISV)
  grids only, and not all advanced stress packages (only LAK and UZF)
* `iMOD-WQ`_, which integrates SEAWAT (density-dependent
  groundwater flow) and MT3DMS (multi-species reactive transport calculations)

Development currently focuses on supporting more Modflow 6 functionalities. 

This Python package is developed primarily by the Groundwater Management Group
at `Deltares`_. It is used together with a broader set of open source tools and
standards for reproducible modeling and data analysis:

* `Git`_: version control of (Python) scripts;
* `DVC`_: version control of data, on top of Git;
* `netCDF`_: open standard of a flexible, self describing data format;
* `Snakemake`_: workflow manager to turn a collection of scripts into a
  workflow.
