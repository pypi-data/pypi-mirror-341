# IOHGNBG

**IOHGNBG** also enables the integration of GNBG problems into IOHprofiler standards. It is provided as a library for use in the [GNBG Competition 2025](https://gecco-2025.sigevo.org/Competition?itemId=2781), with additional details available on the [competition website](https://dsmlossf.github.io/GNBG-Competition-2025/).

As part of the IOHprofiler ecosystem, IOHGNBG is actively developed, with ongoing updates to its features and interfaces.


## Installation

The minimum supported Python version is 3.10. Install IOHGNBG via pip and git:

```bash
pip install iohgnbg
```

## Basic Usage
The following example shows how to get a benchmark GNBG problem (2025 GECCO competition):
```python
import iohgnbg
import ioh
import os
gnbg_problem = iohgnbg.get_problem(1)

print(gnbg_problem.meta_data)

logger = ioh.logger.Analyzer(
    root=os.getcwd(),  # Current working directory
    folder_name="AttachedLogger",  # Folder to store logs
    algorithm_name="None",  # Name of the algorithm (can be customized)
)

# Attach the logger to the created clustering problem
gnbg_problem.attach_logger(logger)
```
