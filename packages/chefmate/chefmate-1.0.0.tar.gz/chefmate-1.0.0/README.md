## Introduction

ChefMate is built to help competitive programmers who participate in CodeChef contests. By automating several routine tasks (such as logging in, opening contest pages, fetching problems, and managing solution submissions), ChefMate removes friction from the contest environment. With its modular design, the tool offers easy configurability and a friendly CLI interface, making the CodeChef contest experience smoother and more productive.

## Architecture and Code Structure

ChefMateâ€™s code is organized into four main modules:

### Browser Manager

**File:** `browser_manager.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Manages the Chrome browser session using Selenium WebDriver.  
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Initialization:** Sets up the ChromeDriver with options such as user-data-dir and profile-directory for isolated sessions.
  - **Conflict Detection:** Checks if a Chrome instance is already running and prompts the user accordingly.
  - **Session Management:** Provides methods to initialize, operate, and close the browser session.  
- **Highlights:**  
  Uses `webdriver_manager` to ensure the correct ChromeDriver is installed and employs custom options to reduce unwanted automation flags.

### Core Functionality

**File:** `chefmate_core.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Acts as the primary interface to ChefMate functionality. It integrates browser automation with the CodeChef website.  
- **Components:**
  - **Login/Logout:**  
    Automates the CodeChef login procedure including form filling, waiting for dashboard elements, and handling potential errors.
  - **Contest Handling:**  
    Opens a contest page, scrapes all available problem links, and dynamically creates a problem tracker.
  - **Solution Handling:**  
    Searches for or prompts for the correct solution file. Generates solution templates based on the preferred programming language.
  - **Submission and Testing:**  
    Provides mechanisms to load code into the CodeChef code editor, submit solutions, and analyze output results by parsing verdict tables.
  - **Interactive Utilities:**  
    Functions like typewriter text effects, dashboard redirection, and dynamic problem tracking to enhance the user experience.

### Command Line Interface

**File:** `cli.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides a user-friendly CLI to interact with ChefMate.  
- **Features:**
  - **CLI Commands:**  
    Implements commands using Click. Commands include `setup`, `login`, `logout`, `check`, `submit`, `contest`, and `interactive`.
  - **Interactive Mode:**  
    An extended menu-driven interface built using InquirerPy that lets users select among different operational modes such as logging in, solving problems, or reconfiguring settings.
  - **UI Enhancements:**  
    Uses the Rich library for improved terminal output, such as styled tables and animated loaders.

### Configuration Management

**File:** `config.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Handles persistent configurations for ChefMate by reading from and writing to a JSON file.  
- **Details:**
  - **Default Configuration:**  
    Automatically creates a configuration file in the user's home directory (`~/.chefmate/config.json`) if it does not exist.
  - **Dynamic Updates:**  
    Offers methods to get, set, and update various settings including username, password, preferred language, solution file paths, and Chrome user data directories.
  - **Robustness:**  
    Includes error handling to recreate a default configuration if the current configuration file is corrupted.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chefmate.git
   cd chefmate
   ```

2. **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ChefMate relies on several Python packages. Install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note:** Dependencies include libraries like Selenium, webdriver-manager, Click, InquirerPy, Rich, and Colorama. Make sure your environment meets the prerequisites for Selenium and ChromeDriver.

## Usage

### Setup

Run the setup command to configure ChefMate with your CodeChef credentials, preferred language, editor, and solution file path:

```bash
python cli.py setup
```

### Login and Logout

To login to CodeChef, use:

```bash
python cli.py login
```

And to logout:

```bash
python cli.py logout
```

### Contest and Problem Management

- **Opening a Contest:**  
  Launch a contest by providing the contest ID and your division using:

  ```bash
  python cli.py contest
  ```

- **Automatic Problem Scraping:**  
  ChefMate will automatically identify and open all the contest problem tabs and display a problem tracker.

### Testing and Submissions

- **Check Demo Test Cases:**  
  Validate your solution using sample test cases:

  ```bash
  python cli.py check --problem 1
  ```

- **Submitting a Solution:**  
  To submit your solution for a given problem:

  ```bash
  python cli.py submit --problem 1
  ```

- **Solving Problems (Template Generation & File Management):**  
  ChefMate automatically generates solution template files in a designated contest directory for you to edit. It opens the selected file in your preferred text editor.

### Interactive Mode

ChefMate also offers an interactive mode that provides a dynamic menu for operations. Launch it with:

```bash
python cli.py interactive
```

In this mode, you can choose among several actions such as login, logout, opening contests, checking demo cases, submitting solutions, and reconfiguring settings.

## Troubleshooting

- **Chrome Profile in Use:**  
  If you receive an error indicating that the Chrome profile is already being used, ensure that all Chrome windows are closed before starting ChefMate.

- **Solution File Issues:**  
  If ChefMate cannot locate your solution file, double-check the path in the configuration (or re-run the `setup` command).

- **Configuration Errors:**  
  If the configuration file is corrupted, ChefMate will automatically generate a new default configuration in `~/.chefmate/config.json`.

- **Network/Slow Load Problems:**  
  For slow networks, ChefMate includes retries during login and test case checks. If problems persist, try restarting your browser or re-running the command.
