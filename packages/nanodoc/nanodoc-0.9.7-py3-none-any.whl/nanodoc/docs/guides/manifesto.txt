1. Less clutter, less distraction

Sometimes you just want to bundle a couple of pieces of texts together, and that's it.

nanodoc does give you some bell and whistles, but they are lean. use txxt format:

2. Session titles are numbered

And in between respectable line breaks.

3. Paragraphs

Paragraphs are split by line breaks.

Like this.

4. Code blocks

Anuthing thats indented by 4 spaces and the first line begins with #

    #
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("Anyone there?") # multiple lines are supported

And optional, but there is change in rendering, specify the code block language:

    # python
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("Anyone there?") # multiple lines are supported

5. Lists

- Use - to start.
- Can be nested
    - Like this.



5.1 Session titles can be nested

Such as this, with no indentation


5.2 Ordered Lists

    1. Use numbers
    2. They will be renumbered if needed
        1. Can be nested
