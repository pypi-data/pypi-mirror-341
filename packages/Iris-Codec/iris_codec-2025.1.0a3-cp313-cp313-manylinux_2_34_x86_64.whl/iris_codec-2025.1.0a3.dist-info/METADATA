         libjpeg-turbo Licenses
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
         libjpeg-turbo is covered by two compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
         
         - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
           [README.ijg](README.ijg)
         
           This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs,
           including any code inherited from libjpeg and any modifications to that
           code.  Note that the libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code bears the
           [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib), but in the context of
           the overall libjpeg API library, the terms of the zlib License are subsumed
           by the terms of the IJG License.
         
         - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below
         
           This license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
           well as the build system.  Note that the TurboJPEG API library wraps the
           libjpeg API library, so in the context of the overall TurboJPEG API library,
           both the terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified (3-clause)
           BSD License apply.
         
         
         Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
         =========================================
         
         This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
         best of our understanding.  This is not a license in and of itself.  It is
         intended solely for clarification.
         
         1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
             then:
         
             1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
                 from the source.
         
                 **Origin**
                 - Clause 1 of the IJG License
                 - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
                 - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
         
             2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
                 file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file.  (If
                 there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
                 simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
         
                 **Origin**
                 - Clause 1 of the IJG License
                 - Clause 2 of the zlib License
         
             3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
                 copyright or license text in that file.
         
                 **Origin**
                 - Clause 1 of the IJG License
         
         2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
             if you are distributing an application that statically links with
             libjpeg-turbo, then:
         
             1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:
         
                 This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
                 Group.
         
                 **Origin**
                 - Clause 2 of the IJG license
         
             2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
                 your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
                 License (see below.)
         
                 **Origin**
                 - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
         
         3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
             contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
         
             **Origin**
             - IJG License
             - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
         
         4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
             free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
             consequences resulting from your use of the software.
         
             **Origin**
             - IJG License
             - Modified BSD License
             - zlib License

         Why Two Licenses?
         =================
         
         The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
         License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
         conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
         libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
         License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
         attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
         desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
         that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

         2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
         3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
            program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
            you've used the IJG code.
         
         In legalese:
         
         The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,

         conditions:
         (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
         README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
         unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
         must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
         (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
         documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
         the Independent JPEG Group".
         (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
         full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
         NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
         
         These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
         not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
         acknowledge us.
         
         Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

         The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
         It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
         The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
         ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
         but is also freely distributable.
         
         The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
         To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
         been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
         "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
         resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
         GIF decoders.
         
         We are required to state that
             "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
             CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

# Iris Codec Community Module

Copyright &copy; 2025 Iris Developers; MIT Software License

The Iris Codec Community module is a part of the Iris Digital Pathology project. This module allows for the reading and writing of Iris whole slide image (WSI) digital slide files (*.iris*) and allows for the decoding of Iris Codec-type compressed tile image data. This repository was designed to allow for extremely fast slide access using what we consider a very simple API as we want to simplify access to these files for you. It may downloaded as pre-compiled binaries in the [releases tab](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/releases), or [may be built](README.md#c-and-c-implementations) as a static or dynamically linked C++ library or [python modules](README.md#python). We have additionally provided these python modules in prebuilt releases on the Anaconda [Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org) Python package manager.

> [!NOTE]
> **If you are a scanning device manufacturer or programmer developing a custom encoder/decoder, the [Iris File Extension (IFE) repository](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-File-Extension) will provide the necessary calls to read, write, and validate slide files in accordance with the Iris File Extension Specification.** The current repository (Iris Codec Module) applies higher level abstractions for slide access and incorporates image codecs for image compression. The IFE repository does not. It is limited to (de)serialization and validation. The Iris Codec Module incorporates the [IFE repository](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-File-Extension) as a dependency, so if you use the IFE respository instead, the Iris Codec module source files may be a helpful guide in how we choose to read and write to Iris files using the IFE's API.

> [!WARNING]
>  The Iris Codec module is still in active development. We do not anticipate altering the established API functions in the [header files](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Headers) but as we add in new features, some elements of the API may change slightly. Please check in regularly if you intend to update your dynamically linked libraries to ensure no API breaking changes have been merged. 

This module has reliatively limited dependencies. As our encoder builds shift away from using OpenSlide, we will add additional library dependencies for reading vendor files. 
- [Iris File Extension](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-File-Extension)
- [Libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo)
- [Libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif)
- [OpenSlide](https://github.com/openslide/openslide) (*optional*, encoder-only) <p>*Note: We may remove this dependency in future releases of the encoder. At the present, this limits Windows encoder builds to x86_64 only. You must disable openslide for ARM based windows encoder builds.*

*If you are a software engineer looking to help with Iris, we are always looking for additional passionate engineers to help in developing the Iris Project.*

# Installation
## Building From Source

This library can be built from source using CMake. 

[![Iris Codec CMake macOS CI](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-macos-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-macos-CI.yml)\
[![Iris Codec Linux CMake CI](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-linux-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-linux-CI.yml)\
[![Iris Codec Windows CMake CI](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-win64-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec/actions/workflows/cmake-win64-CI.yml)

The following shell commands clone and build the repository. Remember to `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` your chosen install directory if not installing system-wide. Additionally, Iris Codec CMake script is designed to look for and dynamically link [turbo-jpeg](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) and [AVIF](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif) by default; however, some implementations would rather simply build a self-contained statically linked binary without the need to dynamically load libraries. **In some instances where reliablity is key, this may be the most secure option.** Some architectures, such as iOS require this. To enable static dependency linkage, instead set `-DIRIS_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES=ON`. More info on the dependencies lookup and **cross compiling** Iris Codec in the [cmake directory](./cmake/).

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec.git
# Configure your install directory with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=''
# The following CMake Arguments are the default arguments; you may remove the -DARG_NAME entries below and it will build the same. I have just included them to add clarity to optional configurations.
cmake -B build \
    -D IRIS_BUILD_SHARED=ON \
    -D IRIS_BUILD_STATIC=ON \
    -D IRIS_BUILD_ENCODER=ON \
    -D IRIS_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES=OFF \
    -D IRIS_BUILD_PYTHON=OFF \
    -D IRIS_USE_OPENSLIDE=ON \
    ./Iris-Codec
cmake --build ./Iris-Codec/build --config Release -j$CPU_COUNT

[![Conda Platforms](https://img.shields.io/conda/pn/conda-forge/iris-codec.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/iris-codec)

>[!NOTE]
> The python Iris Codec Encoder does not support OpenSlide on Windows presently as OpenSlide does not support windows with its official Conda-Forge package. We are building in native support for vendor files and DICOM for re-encoding.

Iris Codec is also available as a Python conda package on the Conda-Forge Anaconda package manager channel. The corresponding python module may also be built from source by setting `-DIRIS_BUILD_PYTHON=ON` in the above CMake command if you would rather build the module rather than install it via Anaconda. 


```shell
conda install -c conda-forge Iris-Codec 
```

## Javascript
[![Iris Codec Emscripten Webassembly Build](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec-JavaScript/actions/workflows/emcmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec-JavaScript/actions/workflows/emcmake.yml)

The [Iris-Codec-JavaScript repository](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Codec-JavaScript) contains the WebAssembly (WASM) build of the Iris Codec library, allowing it to be used in web browsers and Node.js applications. This implementation does not have the same dependencies, as image decoding is performed in the browser with JavaScript native codec tools. 

# Implementations
## C++
Iris is natively a C++ program and the majority of features will first be supported in C++ followed by the other language bindings as we find time to write the bindings. 

Begin by importing the [Iris Codec Core header](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Headers/blob/main/include/IrisCodecCore.hpp); it contains references to the [Iris Codec specific type definitions](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Headers/blob/main/include/IrisCodecTypes.hpp) as well as the general [Iris Core type definitions](https://github.com/IrisDigitalPathology/Iris-Headers/blob/main/include/IrisTypes.hpp). You may chose to perform your own file system validations and recovery routines. Iris will, however catch all of these as the main API methods are declared `noexcept`. Should an runtime error occur, it will be reported in the form of an `IrisResult` message, as seen in the `IrisResult validate_slide (const SlideOpenInfo&) noexcept;` call below. Successful loading of a slide file will return a valid `IrisCodec::Slide` object; failure will return a `nullptr`. 
```cpp
// Import the Iris Codec header
// This import includes the types header automatically
#import <filesystem>
#import <Iris/IrisCodecCore.hpp>
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    using namespace IrisCodec;
    std::filesystem::path file_path = "path/to/slide_file.iris";

    // You can check the file system to see if the slide exists
    // If you choose not to, that's fine too. Iris will tell you.
    if (!std::filesystem::exists(file_path)) {
        printf(file_path.string() + " file does not exist\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // You can quickly check if the header starts with Iris
    // file extension signatures. If not, that's fine too.
    // Iris will catch it during validation.
    if (!is_iris_codec_file(file_path.string())) {
        printf(file_path.string() + " is not a valid Iris slide file\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Create an open slide info struct. Ignore the other
    // parameters at the moment; they will default.
    SlideOpenInfo open_info {
        .filePath = file_path.string();
    };
    // Perform a deep validation of the slide file structure
    // This will navigate the internal offset-chain and
    // check for violations of the IFE standard.
    IrisResult result = validate_slide (open_info);
    if (result != IRIS_SUCCESS) {
        printf (result.message);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    // Finally create the slide object.
    // Most Iris objects are shared_ptrs,
    // so Iris will handle the memory clean-up
    auto slide = open_slide (open_info);
    if (slide) return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    else return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```

Once opened, the slide `IrisCodec::SlideInfo` structure can be loaded using the `Result get_slide_info (const Slide&, SlideInfo&) noexcept` call and used as an initialized structure containing all the information needed to navigate the slide file and read elements.
```cpp
// Read the slide information
SlideInfo info;
IrisResult result = get_slide_info (slide, info);
if (result != IRIS_SUCCESS) {
    printf (result.message);
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

// Slide tile read info provides a simple mechanism
// for reading slide data.
struct SlideTileReadInfo read_info {
    .slide                  = slide,
    .layer                  = 0,
    .optionalDestination    = NULL, /*wrapper can go here*/
    .desiredFormat          = Iris::FORMAT_R8G8B8A8,
};
// Iterate
for (auto& layer : info.extent.layers) {
    for (int y_index = 0; y_index < layer.yTiles; ++y_index) {
        for (int x_index = 0; x_index < layer.xTiles; ++x_index) {
            // Read the tile slide tile
            auto rgba = read_slide_tile (read_info);
            // Do something with the tile pixel values
            // Do not worry about clean up; the slide
            // pixel values are in a Iris::Buffer shared_ptr
        }
    }
    read_info.layer++;
}
if (optional_buffer) free (optional_buffer);
```
Decompressed slide data can be optionally read into preallocated memory. If the optional destination buffer is insufficiently sized, Iris will instead allocate a new buffer and return that new buffer with the pixel data. The `Iris::Buffer` should weakly reference the underlying memory as strongly referenced `Iris::Buffer` objects free underlying memory on deletion.
```cpp
char* some_GPU_upload_buffer;
size_t tile_byte_offset;
char* destination = some_GPU_upload_buffer + tile_byte_offest;
size_t tile_bytes = 256*256*4;
Iris::Buffer wrapper = Wrap_weak_buffer_fom_data (destination, tile_bytes);
struct SlideTileReadInfo read_info {
    .slide                  = slide,
    .optionalDestination    = NULL, /*wrapper can go here*/
    .desiredFormat          = Iris::FORMAT_R8G8B8A8,
};
Buffer result = read_slide_tile (read_info);
if (weak_wrapper != result) {
    printf ("Insufficient sized buffer provided");
}
```


## Python
```python
#Import the Iris Codec Module
from Iris import Codec
slide_path = 'path/to/slide_file.iris'

# Perform a deep validation of the slide file structure
# This will navigate the internal offset-chain and
# check for violations of the IFE standard.
result = Codec.validate_slide_path(slide_path)
if (result.success() == False):
    raise Exception(f'Invalid slide file path: {result.message()}')
print(f"Slide file '{slide_path}' successfully passed validation")
