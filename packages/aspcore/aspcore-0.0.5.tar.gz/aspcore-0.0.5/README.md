# ASPCORE : Audio Signal Processing Core
## Introduction
The package contains classes and functions implementing different versions of linear convolutions. What makes them useful above what's already available in scipy and numpy is that they are intended to be used in a streaming manner, where only parts of the input signal is available at a time. All filters support multiple inputs and multiple outputs. There is also support for convolution with a time-varying impulse response. 

The package uses just-in-time compilation from numba to achieve lower computational cost.
