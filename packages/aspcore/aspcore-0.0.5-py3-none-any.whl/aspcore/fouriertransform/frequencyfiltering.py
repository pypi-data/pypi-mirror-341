"""Methods for linear convolution and correlation in the frequency domain

The following methods can be helpful for filtering using frequency-domain filters
when multiple channels are involved. When possible, for correlation and convolution 
the functions will zero-pad the signals correctly in order to avoid circular convolution. 

In particular, the functions can be useful frequency domain adaptive filters, where overlap-save
is used for both linear convolutions and correlations. It can be tricky there to get 
the zero-padding right.
